# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.62.1] - 2026-04-23

*CHANGELOG style discipline adopted + retroactive condensation of verbose v0.48.0–v0.62.0 entries.*

### Added
- CLAUDE.md "CHANGELOG style discipline" subsection (Build pipeline): no `Layers impacted` header, no prose intro, no meta sections (Rationale / Notes / Audit trail / Verification), bullets ≤25 words, budget ≤15 lines per release.
- `docs/post-audit-reports/2026-04-22-series-v0.58-v0.60.md`: preserves the 9-cluster synthesis migrated from inline v0.60.0 CHANGELOG.

### Changed
- Condensed v0.48.0 → v0.62.0 CHANGELOG entries (34 releases) from ~950 lines to ~300 lines (-68%). Content preserved at the semantic level; rationale + meta sections migrated to commit messages, spec/design, or `docs/post-audit-reports/`.

## [0.62.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Audit category F "Distribution hygiene": 5 deterministic checks — language, secrets, personal leaks, debug residue, runtime path integrity.
- `/gse-audit --distribution-only` flag.
- Principle 11 "Product-vs-source dualism" in methodology-auditor.md.
- Explicit `<!-- /multilingual by design -->` end marker + header-based implicit closure in hug.md Step 0.

### Changed
- `audit.py` CATEGORIES extended 12→17; `/gse-audit` catalog 21→26 jobs across 6 categories.

## [0.61.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `<!-- multilingual by design: pre-language-selection UI -->` marker in hug.md Step 0.

### Changed
- Orchestrator beginner term mapping: 4 French examples replaced with English equivalents (✅/❌ emojis retained).
- hug.md beginner-flow trace: translated FR→EN (adjacent expert-flow was already EN).
- 3 "For beginners" dashboard messages (compound, review, hug) aligned in English with `(adapt wording to the user's language)` suffix.
- Internal prefix `AMÉL` renamed to `ENH` (5 occurrences across `gse_generate.py`, `gse-orchestrator.md`, `dashboard.py`).

### Removed
- French cue `"c'est fait"` from hug.md git identity Gate (kept `"done"` / `"ok"`).

## [0.61.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `plugin/VERSION` — generator-managed 1-line file distributed to every install target.
- `~/.gse-one.d/` side-install directory for Claude Code plugin mode.
- `_copy_common_assets()` / `_remove_common_assets()` helpers in `install.py`.

### Changed
- `install.py` all 6 install modes now write `~/.gse-one` pointing to the install target (was: gensem source repo in 5 of 6 modes). Installs are self-contained.
- opencode (both modes) and claude/cursor no-plugin now distribute `tools/`, `templates/`, `references/`, `VERSION` uniformly.
- `go.md` Activity Execution Fidelity table collapsed 3→2 branches.
- `hug.md` Step 4: plugin-version read unified to `cat "$(cat ~/.gse-one)/VERSION"`.
- CLAUDE.md "Tool architecture" section rewritten with per-mode registry table.

### Fixed
- opencode no-plugin installs now include Python tools (unblocks dashboard usage).
- Version-stamping in `hug.md` now works across all 6 install modes.

## [0.60.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- `/gse:deploy` training subdomain format: `{DEPLOY_USER}-{project}.{DOMAIN}` → `{project}-{DEPLOY_USER}.{DOMAIN}` (application first for readability). Aligned 6 docs/skill/template sites + 1 test assertion to match `deploy.py build_subdomain`.
- design §5.18 Subdomain derivation rule + motivating example updated to new format.

## [0.60.0] - 2026-04-22

*Closes 2026-04-22 audit remediation series (v0.58.0–v0.60.0); full synthesis in `docs/post-audit-reports/2026-04-22-series-v0.58-v0.60.md`.*

### Added
- deploy-operator.md: new "User role & orientation (Step -1)" section.
- deploy-operator.md: new "CDN metadata (Phase 5 Step 7)" section.

### Changed
- spec §3.8 + design §5.18 + deploy.py docstring + deploy.md Step -1: 4-option menu vs 3-role enum distinction made explicit across the 3 layers.

### Removed
- `skip` from `user_role` enum (dead aspirational value; never written).

## [0.59.5] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- design §5.16 Sprint Freeze: `/gse:deliver` retracted from "MUST consult" list (was double-listed in consult AND exempt).
- spec §14 guardrail 3 + design §5.16: exempt activities prose upgraded to three-category typology (closed-sprint consumer / non-mutating / transition performer).

## [0.59.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- deliver.md Step 1.5 Guardrail 2 "Unexecuted test strategy" (Hard, blocks when declared test level has no TCP- campaign). Spec §9.3.1 fidelity.
- tests.md `--run --level <level>` flag (unit / integration / e2e / policy).
- design §5.15 Test-Specific Guardrails expanded: 1 → 3 labeled guardrails.

## [0.59.3] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- 3 broken cross-references: spec §14.3 Step 5.7 → Step 5 sub-point 8; spec §3 Adopt Mode → §14.2 (also in design §5); review.md Step 3.5 → §P15 Confidence Integration (6 reviewer agents).

### Changed
- 7 residual bare path references upgraded to `plugin/...` form (activities: plan, review, tests×2, audit, compound; orchestrator).

## [0.59.2] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- go.md Step 2.8 moment tag corrected to canonical `/gse:go after recovery check` (was: `after recovery`).
- Orchestrator P14 bullet aligned on spec §P14 5-option canonical wording.
- coach.md Invocation contract table: 8 → 12 rows (4 event-trigger rows added).
- design §5.1 `/gse:learn` proactive preamble aligned on spec §P14 canonical.
- spec §P14 template option 1 prose aligned with canonical block (removed fluff).
- profile.yaml `competency_map.topics.mode` enum: added `contextual` (3 values).

### Removed
- coach.md axis 1 orphan trigger "Gate decisions with high pedagogical load" (no anchor).

## [0.59.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Orchestrator Sprint Plan Maintenance Step 4.2: vague "update current_phase if transitioning" replaced by explicit triple-trigger rule (LC00→LC01, LC01→LC02, LC02→LC03).
- design §10.1 Sprint Plan Lifecycle Step 6: mirror sync on the 3 deterministic transitions.

### Removed
- Direct cursor writes (`last_activity`, `last_activity_timestamp`, `current_phase`) retracted from 5 activities (compound, pause, resume, integrate, deliver). Centralized per orchestrator protocol (v0.53.0 regression fix).

## [0.59.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- `status.yaml.audit_history` schema slot (cap 20 entries) for `/gse:audit` Step 6 writer.
- `status.yaml.gse_version` writer (hug.md Step 4) + reader (dashboard.py header).
- `sprint/audit.md` entry in `MANIFEST.yaml`.
- `status.yaml.review_findings_open` writer contract (review.md Step 6 + fix.md Step 6) — activates dormant git-push warning hook.
- `pushback_dismissed` writer anchor in principles/adversarial-review.md (orchestrator owns P16 counters).

### Changed
- spec §12.3 TASK status enum: 8 → 9 values (added `reviewed`, aligns with backlog.yaml).
- design §14.3 open-question #3 (`gse_version`): writer + reader now activated; migration logic deferred to first breaking schema change.

### Removed
- `status.yaml.last_task` orphan writes (produce.md + task.md) — field never in schema, never read.
- task.md Step 6.3 direct cursor writes (cursor-centralization per v0.53.0 protocol).
- top-level `complexity:` block from spec §12.4 + design §5.16 samples (dead schema; plan.yaml.budget is authoritative).
- `commits: 12` from spec §12.3 backlog example (git is authoritative).

## [0.58.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- design `/gse:audit` heading renumbered §5.17 → §5.19 (fixes duplicate with Coach §5.17; monotonic §5 ordering restored).
- spec §P14:945 cross-reference upgraded to "design §5.17 — Additional Skill Extensions" (number+name convention).

## [0.58.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- `AUD-` meta-scope note in spec §P6 Artefact ID allocation table.
- `AUDIT` row in spec Appendix A Activity Summary.
- `audit` row in orchestrator Command Reference table.

### Changed
- Activities/skills/commands count: 23 → 24 everywhere (14 locations across 4 files).
- Templates count: 28/29 → 30 everywhere (4 locations).
- design §4 intro: stale "17+5" count replaced by self-descriptive reference to §5.
- design §5.18 `/gse:deploy` intro: fragile ordinal "23rd command" replaced with functional description.

## [0.57.0] - 2026-04-22

*Triggered by a Cursor sprint transcription (CalcApp) exposing 11 methodology drifts, merged into 8 coherent clusters.*

### Added
- spec §9.3.1 Test-Specific Guardrails: 3 guardrails on `/gse:deliver` Step 1.5 (Unexecuted tests, Unexecuted test strategy, Stale evidence).
- spec §15 Methodology Audit (Glossary renumbered §16).
- spec §P6 `AUD-` prefix (audit findings, distinct from `RVW-`).
- `/gse:audit` activity (24th GSE-One activity, cross-cutting).
- design §3.4 Dashboard parser format contracts.
- design §5.17 `/gse:audit` architecture subsection.
- Activity Execution Fidelity Invariant (spec §14.3, design §5.14, orchestrator): every Step MUST execute unless conditional/user-overridden/frontmatter-exempt; agent-driven skips emit Inform.
- `project-audit.py` deterministic engine (15 Phase 1 checks).
- `sprint/audit.md` report template.
- deliver.md Step 1.5 Test Execution Evidence (consumer of `test_evidence` field).
- `AskUser` methodology alias + runtime mapping (orchestrator P4): AskUserQuestion (Claude) / AskQuestion (Cursor ≥2.4) / question (opencode).
- opencode permission `question: allow`.
- E2E screenshots as default evidence in tests.md.

### Changed
- P4 Human-in-the-Loop elevated from "preferred" to "canonical": interactive mode MUST for finite-option questions; text fallback bifurcated into content-forced (silent) vs runtime-forced (emits Inform).
- dashboard.py format parsers aligned on canonical formats (count_reqs: `### REQ-NNN` H3; count_review_findings: `RVW-NNN [SEVERITY]` brackets, adds CRITICAL; health dimensions: nested `health.dimensions.<dim>` lookup with fallbacks).

### Fixed
- `/gse:go` on greenfield now preserves HUG Step 0 canonical 5-option QCM (was degraded to 3-option text).
- `/gse:deliver` now blocks Hard on missing/failed/skipped test evidence (was: silent merge).
- Dashboard no longer reports "0 REQs / 0 findings / No health data" on valid projects.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- CLAUDE.md "Post-audit fix workflow" section (5-phase protocol, version bump matrix, contract change isolation pattern).
- methodology-auditor.md Principle 10 "Structured verdict in verification mode" (CONFIRMED / FALSE_POSITIVE / NEEDS_REFINEMENT / SCOPE_CHANGE).
- `.claude/commands/gse-audit.md` Phase 3.5 "Anti-false-positive verification pass".

### Changed
- methodology-auditor.md Principle 6 extended: 2 → 3 refinement directions (downward / upward / retraction).
- methodology-auditor.md YAML output: added `verdict` + `verdict_rationale` fields; `direction` enum gained `retraction`.

## [0.55.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- 11 contract tests in `test_deploy.py` (test count 49 → 60).
- 17 docstrings in `deploy.py` (9 public + 8 private helpers).

### Changed
- 5 `record_*` library functions in `deploy.py` now return uniform `{"status": "ok"|"error", ...}` dict (mirrors `record_role` reference pattern).
- 5 `_cmd_record_*` CLI wrappers: read dict, call `_json_out`, exit 2 on error.
- record_server / record_coolify / record_domain / record_cdn: new validation on empty required fields.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- spec §3.2.2 Profile Update Mode (catches up on hug.md Step 4.5 dimension table).
- spec §14.3 Step 5 skip matrix clause #7 (3 Intent Capture skip conditions).
- spec §P13: opencode native TS plugin hooks now documented alongside Claude Code and Cursor.
- design §7: explicit citation of spec §P11 Guardrails as source of Soft/Hard/Emergency tier taxonomy.
- hug.md Step 2: 3 entry points into `/gse:learn` documented (direct invocation, coach proactive gap, compound Axe 3).

### Changed
- preview.md Step 2.5 UX Heuristic Pass: narrow 2-domain gate (web/mobile) → 9-domain surface-based decision matrix.
- audit.py: CHANGELOG filter in `audit_links()`; partitive lookahead in `audit_numeric()`; ±1 drift emits info (not warning).
- `.claude/audit-jobs.json` quality-assurance-cluster: indent-tolerant `perspective:` matching documented.

## [0.53.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- CLAUDE.md "Activity path reference conventions" section (runtime-executable / pedagogical / methodology-source forms).
- CLAUDE.md "Activity structural conventions" section (Flat Step / Multi-mode / Phase-over-Step patterns with inline notes in 4 multi-mode activities).

### Changed
- deploy-operator.md Anti-patterns: fused 2 bullets, corrected `/start (full rebuild)` → `GET /api/v1/deploy?uuid=...&force=true` (real Coolify redeploy path).
- design §5.18 subcommand enumeration: 14 → 20 entries.
- design §5.18 state schema: added `user_role` and `cdn { provider, enabled, bot_protection }` blocks.
- audit.py: 11 `audit_*` category entry points received missing one-line docstrings.
- dashboard.py `@gse-tool` version string normalized 0.17.0 → 1.0.
- audit.py: `print()` calls moved from `collect_data()` library into `generate()` CLI entry point.

### Removed
- 5 activities (plan, produce, review, fix, deliver) stopped writing status.yaml cursor fields directly — centralized per orchestrator Sprint Plan Maintenance protocol.

## [0.52.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- `sessions_without_progress` writer (go.md Step 4 Stale Sprint Detection + resume.md Step 6), activating the coach `mid_sprint_stall` axis.
- design §5.14 Preflight sequence: 3 new subsections (Recovery Check, Dependency Vulnerability Check, Git Baseline Verification).

### Changed
- guardrail-enforcer documented as Compliance archetype (canonical rule reference, not runtime sub-agent spawn).

### Fixed
- dashboard.py:442-443: wrong `status.complexity_*` keys → `plan.budget.total/consumed` (with Micro-mode fallback).

### Removed
- P16 `never_*` quartet (4 booleans declared but never written; P16 remains operational via `consecutive_acceptances` + `pushback_dismissed`).
- Top-level `complexity:` block from status.yaml template (plan.yaml.budget is authoritative).
- `git.commits: 0` from backlog.yaml template (git is authoritative).
- 15 legacy G-NNN gap-analysis identifiers stripped from design §5 (no legend, no registry).

## [0.51.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- 13 cross-reference "number + name" upgrades across spec, activities, templates.
- coach.md:136 corrected from "opt-in" to "opt-out" (config default is `true`).
- 7 SSH invocations in ssh-operations.md aligned on `-o ConnectTimeout=10` mandatory rule.
- Hetzner reference freshness markers added to all 5 volatile sections.
- deploy-env.example: added SERVER_IP / SSH_USER / SSH_KEY commented placeholders.
- config.yaml: swapped sections 14 (Compound) and 15 (Coach) for monotone numbering; header count refreshed to "~60 keys / 15 sections".
- Orchestrator P6 bullet: ID prefixes 8 → 11 (added TCP-, INT-, OQ-); artefact_type 7 → 8 (added `spike`).
- learn.md Step 4 LRN frontmatter: full canonical 5-field set per spec §P14; `mode` enum expanded to contextual/quick/deep.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- TASK status `reviewed` (between `review` and `fixing`/`done`) in backlog.yaml, spec §12.3, design §10.1, 8 activities, dashboard.py.

### Changed
- `/gse:produce` transitions `in-progress → review` (was: direct to `done`); `/gse:review` transitions review → reviewed (clean) or review → fixing (findings); `/gse:fix` transitions fixing → done; `/gse:deliver` accepts reviewed OR done.
- `/gse:task` Step 1 artefact_type: maps to canonical spec §P6 enum (was: invalid feat/fix/refactor/task).
- 4 agent invocations reconciled: requirements-analyst + reqs.md Step 7.5 (downward), security-auditor + design.md Step 5.5 (downward), ux-advocate + preview.md Step 2.5 (downward), test-strategist + produce.md (upward retraction).
- `decisions.md` canonical path unified on `.gse/decisions.md` (project-wide per spec §11); fixed orchestrator + compound.md pointers.
- deploy-operator.md + ssh-operations.md: phase keys aligned on canonical `coolify` / `dns`.
- spec §13.1 config `project.domain`: 6 → 9 canonical values.
- Coach schema: top-level key `verdict:` → `coach:`; severity enum `inform|gate` → `low|medium|high`; invocation moments renamed to explicit activity references.
- spec §13.1 github block: `upstream_repo` field added with cascade resolution.

## [0.50.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- methodology-auditor.md Principle 8 "Verification before report" + Principle 9 "Anti-rigidity check".
- methodology-auditor.md "number + name" cross-reference convention in Output format.
- CLAUDE.md "Methodology meta-principles" section: Meta-1 (Anti-rigidity discipline) + Meta-2 (Document exceptions inline).
- spec §12.2: section-level vs document-level artefact storage patterns documented.
- audit-jobs.json new job `invocation-contract-consistency` (Category D, 20 → 21 jobs).
- tests/test_audit.py: 12 regression tests against known false-positive classes.

## [0.49.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- CLAUDE.md "Principle title convention (spec long / implementation short)" section with 7-row example table and P13 noted exception.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- CLAUDE.md "Pre-release backward-compatibility — not required (temporary rule)" section.
- CLAUDE.md "Cross-reference convention — number + name" section.

## [0.48.9] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- audit.py `audit_numeric()`: CHANGELOG.md removed from scan (historical entries are legitimate).
- audit.py `audit_numeric()`: regex prefix `(?:^|\s)` added to 3 patterns (excludes section numbers like "§3.10" + principle IDs like "P10").
- audit.py `audit_numeric()`: negative lookahead on `specialized` pattern excludes "templates/files/rules/..." false matches.

## [0.48.8] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- principles/iterative-incremental.md H1: "Iterative-Incremental Development" → "Iterative & Incremental" (aligns on orchestrator short form). Other 9 principles flagged as drift follow the intentional "spec long / implementation short" pattern — convention documented in v0.49.1.

## [0.48.7] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- deploy.md:34 Workflow structure note: documents the Phase/Step hierarchy is intentional (idempotent milestones tracked in `deploy.json → phases_completed`).

### Changed
- deploy.md:11 Options table header: `Flag` → `Flag / Sub-command` (canonical form).
- deploy.md:25 Prerequisites preamble: `Read before execution:` → `Before executing, read:` (canonical form).

## [0.48.6] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- deliver.md Step 0: broken ref Step 10 → Step 8 — Cleanup Backup Tags.
- Design §14 Open Questions row 6: self-contradictory `/gse:go Step 2.5 (spec §14.3 Step 1.6)` → explicit Step 1.6 with name.

### Changed
- Design §13 vintage disclaimer strengthened: all numeric counts in §13 explicitly marked historical.
- Design §3.2 Plugin Manifest examples: frozen `"version": "0.16.0"` → `"X.Y.Z"` placeholder.
- coach.md frontmatter: removed historical phrase "Absorbs the v0.36 tutor agent."

## [0.48.5] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- hug.md:98 Dimension 8 Project domain enum: 7 → 9 values (added `library`, `scientific`).
- Spec §3.2.1:1143 Project domain examples: 6 capitalized → 9 canonical lowercase values (aligned with profile.yaml canonical schema).

## [0.48.4] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- learning-note.md template: nested `gse:{...}` frontmatter → flat `id / artefact_type / title / topic / sprint / status / mode / ...` schema (aligns with intent.md document-level pattern).
- Spec §P14 frontmatter example + path example rewritten on flat format with `LRN-{NNN}-` filename prefix.
- Spec §12.2 `gse.type` enum: `learning-note` removed (document-level artefact uses flat schema).
- principles/knowledge-transfer.md frontmatter + filename tree: rewritten on flat format per MANIFEST `LRN-{NNN}-*` pattern.

## [0.48.3] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- principles/knowledge-transfer.md Examples 1 & 2: preamble labels aligned on spec §P14 canonical wording (`Quick overview (5 min)` / `Deep session (15 min)`).

## [0.48.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- pause.md Step 2: removed duplicate `checkpoint.timestamp` line with invalid nested path (kept flat `timestamp` per schema).
- pause.md Step 1: orphan `git.last_pause_commit` replaced with schema-declared `git.last_commit` (no reader existed for the orphan).

## [0.48.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Spec §12.3 `origin` enum: 5 → 6 values (added `ad-hoc`, already used by task.md + backlog.md).
- Spec §13.1 `deploy.app_type` enum: 4 → 6 values (added `node`, `custom`).

### Fixed
- reqs.md Step 8 persist block: added missing `elicitation_summary` field.
- assess.md Step 5: invalid `status: pool` → `status: open` + `sprint: null` (canonical pool encoding).
- backlog.md Step 3 GitHub-sync mapping: first row corrected (no `pool` status; `open` + `sprint: null` → GitHub `open (label: pool)`).

## [0.48.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Compliance agent archetype (guardrail-enforcer) separated from Reviewer archetype. 5 archetypes total.
- Coach invocation contract implemented in 4 activities: pause.md Step 3.5, compound.md Step 2.0 + Step 3, plan.md --strategic Step 0.6 (activates 3 previously dormant coach axes).
- compound.md Step 2.7: workflow-observations summarization mechanism (ledger maintenance).
- gse_generate.py `verify_external_docs()`: warning-level check on README/install.py count mentions.
- CLAUDE.md "Communication style (development sessions)" section: pedagogical phrasing + single-default questions rules.

### Changed
- `workflow_observations[]` lifecycle unified across 4 files: persistent cross-sprint ledger (was: transient, contradicted design §5.17).
- review.md Step 6 FIX insertion threshold: "HIGH or MEDIUM" (was: "HIGH only"; aligns with spec §14).
- code-reviewer.md aligned on Reviewer archetype (perspective field + severity legend + CRITICAL note).
- Fix-label harmonized to `Suggestion:` in code-reviewer + security-auditor (devil-advocate keeps `Action:` by design).
- design §11.1 + §12: templates count 28 → 29.

### Fixed
- Numeric drift across user-facing docs: install.py "10 specialized agents", README "11 agents / 29 templates".

## [0.47.10] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **design** (docs only)

**Methodology coherence pass — tenth batch (closure)** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Closes the sole remaining audit item deferred from Prop 9 (structural spec/design corrections).

### Changed
- **design §14 Open Questions** — added explicit `Status` column (OPEN / RESOLVED / DEFERRED) and renamed `Recommendation` to `Recommendation / Resolution` across all 10 entries. Each row now clearly states whether the recommendation is implemented in current code or still pending:
  - **RESOLVED (6):** #1 orchestrator principles embedding; #5 lazy worktree creation; #6 branch-level git hygiene + dependency audit; #7 `.gse/` main-only; #8 contextual tip frequency caps; #10 state-recovery resilience.
  - **OPEN (4):** #2 Cursor marketplace + npm packaging (Claude marketplace done); #3 `.gse/` version upgrades (field done, migration logic pending); #4 git conflicts during deliver (no 3-option Gate); #9 external source shallow-clone caching (throwaway currently).
- Entry #1 un-strike-through'd: keeping a single plain "RESOLVED" label is more readable than mixing strikethrough for one row vs plain text for nine others.

### Notes
- Pure documentation change in the design doc. No plugin impact, no behavioral change.
- The 4 OPEN items are now actionable pending tasks with explicit "what's done vs what remains" text. They can be promoted to individual propositions in a future audit cycle.
- This closes the treatment plan from the initial /gse-audit run against v0.45.0: **16 of 16 propositions delivered** over commits v0.47.1 → v0.47.10.

## [0.47.9] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **implementation**, **docs** (agents uniformity + archetype documentation)

**Methodology coherence pass — ninth batch (final mechanical pass)** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Closes the agent-file uniformity findings while deliberately preserving legitimate archetype differences.

### Fixed
- **Output Format heading casing** unified across agents:
  - `deploy-operator.md`: "Output format" (lowercase f) → "Output Format"
  - `coach.md`: "Output formats" (lowercase f) → "Output Formats" (plural preserved — coach legitimately has 3 output formats: skip, propose, advise)
  - 8 other agents already on "Output Format" — unchanged.
- **gse-orchestrator.md header** — added canonical `**Role:**` and `**Activated by:**` lines + wrapped the opening narrative in `## Perspective`. All 10 other agents use this structure; the orchestrator was the sole exception. Now any parser / `/gse-audit` sub-agent / forker reading the agent frontmatter finds consistent metadata.

### Added
- **CLAUDE.md `## Agent archetypes` section** documenting the 4 deliberate structural archetypes:
  - **Identity** (gse-orchestrator) — orchestrator-specific structure
  - **Reviewer** (8 agents) — Checklist + Output Format pattern (output to review.md)
  - **Operational** (deploy-operator) — Required readings + Core Principles + Anti-patterns
  - **Observational** (coach) — 8 axes + Invocation contract + Recipes + Persistence
  
  This documentation prevents future confusion about "why don't all agents have the same structure" — the differences are intentional and reflect distinct agent roles. The common elements (frontmatter, Role/Activated by/Perspective, finding output format) are called out.

### Notes
- Closes Prop 15 of the Prop 1-15 audit treatment plan. 14 of 15 props completed; 1 item deferred (design §14 Open Questions status labeling, pending per-row judgment).
- No spec or design edit — purely agent file uniformity + developer documentation.

## [0.47.8] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **implementation**, **templates** (state management cluster pass)

**Methodology coherence pass — eighth batch** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Six state-management drifts: stale hardcoded version, missing pause/resume fields, task.md using the wrong YAML shape (mapping vs list), backlog schema incomplete, config enum missing Micro, deploy templates still marked PENDING, and one config key referenced but non-existent.

### Fixed
- **`status.yaml` template `gse_version: "0.9.0"`** hardcoded → `""` (filled by /gse:hug from VERSION registry). Prevents newly-seeded projects from inheriting a stale version.
- **`status.yaml` template missing `session_paused` and `pause_checkpoint`** added. Previously written by pause.md Step 3 and cleared by resume.md Step 6, but the template didn't declare them — schema drift.
- **task.md §Step 3 YAML shape** fixed: was writing `TASK-{next_id}: {fields}` (mapping form) into `items: []` (list). YAML-incompatible — would either corrupt backlog or write to the wrong location. Now uses canonical list-of-objects form `- id: TASK-{next_id}\n  title: ...`.
- **task.md field names** aligned on backlog.yaml template:
  - `source: ad-hoc` → `origin: ad-hoc` (template's canonical enum)
  - `created_at: {timestamp}` → `created: {ISO-8601 timestamp}` (template's field name)
  - Sprint values: `S{NN}` → `{NN}` (integer, as template specifies)
  - Added `priority`, `traces`, `git`, `github_issue`, `updated` fields to match template structure.
- **config.yaml `lifecycle.mode` comment** extended from `full | lightweight` to `full | lightweight | micro (see spec §13.2)`. Micro was a valid third mode already used elsewhere but the enum comment hid it.
- **MANIFEST.yaml deploy PENDING block removed** — `/gse:deploy` is production-ready since v0.42.0. Registered 8 deploy templates: `deploy.json`, `deploy-env.example`, `deploy-env-training.example`, `Dockerfile.streamlit`, `Dockerfile.python`, `Dockerfile.node`, `Dockerfile.static`, `.dockerignore`. MANIFEST now declares 29 templates (was 21).
- **backlog.md `github.issues_sync`** (non-existent config key) replaced with canonical `github.enabled: true AND github.sync_mode ∈ {on-activity, real-time}` across 2 occurrences. Prevents silent broken check.
- **backlog.md `github_issue` nesting** corrected: previously `github_issue: null` was placed **inside** `traces: {}`, but the backlog.yaml template has it at the item top-level. backlog.md example now matches.

### Changed
- **backlog.yaml template extended** with 8 new documented fields to formalize the canonical schema: `description`, `requires_review`, `completed_at`, and 4 spike-specific fields (`question`, `complexity_cap`, `deliverable`, `outcome`). All optional; existing backlogs remain valid.
- **config.yaml `project.domain` enum comment** aligned with the fused `project_domain` enum from Prop 6: `web | api | cli | data | mobile | embedded | library | scientific | other`. Previously used the old template enum `web | embedded | scientific | cli | library | mobile`.

### Notes
- No activity, agent, or principle added/removed.
- MANIFEST deploy entries now make the template system the single source of truth for what `/gse:deploy` copies into user projects.
- A future pass could address: checkpoint.yaml `health_score` flat vs status.yaml `health.score` nested naming asymmetry (cosmetic drift flagged by audit but not functional).

## [0.47.7] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (coach/pedagogy cluster pass)

**Methodology coherence pass — seventh batch** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Targets coach axis naming drift (functional bug: config keys not matching), `workflow_observations[]` lifecycle contradiction, P14 preamble 5-option divergence across 3 documents, and a gap in spec coverage of the 7 workflow axes.

### Fixed
- **Coach axis naming** — design §5.17 output schema aligned on snake_case full names from coach.md: `sprint_velocity`, `workflow_health`, `quality_trends`, `engagement_pattern`, `process_deviation`, `sustainability`, `profile_calibration`. Previously design used shortened ambiguous tokens (`velocity`, `health`, `quality`, `engagement`, `deviation`, `profile-calibration` kebab) that did not match coach.md — breaking the `config.yaml → coach.axes.<name>: false` toggle (user-written snake_case would not match the design-side check).
- **`workflow_observations[]` lifecycle** — design §5.17 persistence table corrected from "Transient — cleared at sprint close after consumption by compound" to "**Persistent** — cross-sprint ledger for trending". Quality trends, sprint velocity, and sustainability axes all require ≥ 3 sprints of history to compute meaningful trends; purging at sprint close broke trending.
- **P14 preamble 5-option labels** unified across 3 documents onto canonical wording:
  - Option 1: "Quick overview (5 min) — concise introduction"
  - Option 2: "Deep session (15 min) — worked example + practice"
  - Options 3-5 unchanged (Not now / Not interested / Discuss).
  Previously: spec §P14 used "Yes, quick overview (5 min)" / "Yes, deeper session (15 min)"; learn.md used "Quick overview (5 min) — core REST principles" / "Deep dive (15 min) — REST design patterns"; coach.md used compact "Quick overview" / "Deep session". Now all three agree.

### Added
- **spec §P14 "Workflow monitoring axes"** subsection listing the 7 non-pedagogy axes (profile_calibration through sustainability) with signal source and output type per axis. Previously §P14 described pedagogy in detail but never enumerated the 7 workflow axes at the spec layer — readers had to discover them in design §5.17 or coach.md.
- **spec §P14 "P14 preamble — 5-option format (canonical)"** subsection formalizing the 5 options with their canonical labels and persistence rules (options 3/4 recorded in `status.yaml → learning_preambles[]`). Serves as the shared reference for coach.md / learn.md / orchestrator preambles.
- **go.md Step 2.8 "Coach Workflow Overview (post-recovery)"** — explicit invocation of the coach agent after recovery checks complete, activating axes 2-8 for cross-sprint drift signals. Previously coach.md cited "/gse:go after recovery" as an invocation moment but go.md didn't document the invocation.

### Changed
- **learn.md "Proactive Workflow" section** simplified to a pointer to coach.md + design §5.17 + spec §P14. Previously learn.md documented its own 4-trigger list (duplicating coach.md's 8 moments + design's 9 moments with different vocabulary). Now `/gse:learn` owns the Reactive path; the Proactive path is owned by the coach agent.
- **learn.md Structured Interaction Pattern** aligned on canonical 5-option labels.

### Notes
- No functional regression: the persistence change for `workflow_observations[]` enables trending that was implicitly required by quality_trends/velocity/sustainability axes. Existing projects with an empty `workflow_observations[]` list continue to work — the coach fills it across upcoming sprints.
- Open: design §5.17 invocation moments table (lines 2202-2212) uses tokens like `activity_start:/gse:*`, `compound_axe_3` which don't match coach.md's prose (e.g. "/gse:compound Axe 3 feed"). This is moment-naming convention (machine-facing vs human-facing) and is kept as-is for now — both are unambiguous and reference the same moments.

## [0.47.6] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **implementation**, **templates** (delivery/compound cluster pass)

**Methodology coherence pass — sixth batch** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Targets deliver/compound/integrate cluster drifts: dangerous backup-tag format divergence, LC02/LC03 ambiguity, compound template axes mismatched with activity, integrate missing github.enabled gate, and template gaps.

### Fixed
- **Safety backup tag format** — deliver.md Step 0 was tagging the wrong ref (feature branch instead of integration branch) with a format (`gse-backup/sprint-{NN}-pre-merge-{type}-{name}` on `gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}`) that diverged from spec §10.6 and design §5.15. **Functional bug**: the merge-reversal procedure in spec §10.6:2023 (`git reset --hard gse-backup/...`) could not work because the tag didn't point at the right ref. deliver.md now documents **two tag classes** aligned with spec + design:
  - **Class 1 (merge reversal):** `gse-backup/sprint-{NN}-pre-merge-{type}-{name}` on `gse/sprint-{NN}/integration` BEFORE merge — enables `git reset --hard` rollback.
  - **Class 2 (branch recovery):** `gse-backup/sprint-{NN}-{type}-{name}-deleted` on `gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}` BEFORE branch delete — enables branch recreation.
- **LC02/LC03 deliver ambiguity** — deliver.md Step 9.3 write `current_phase: LC03` now carries an explicit comment: `/gse:deliver` is the **last LC02 activity** per spec §14 ladder; its Step 9.3 marks the post-delivery transition to LC03. Compound and integrate operate in LC03.
- **compound template Axis 2** renamed from "Ecosystem Feedback" to **"Methodology Capitalization"** with tables aligned on activity §2.1–§2.6 (Observations Gathered / Themes Consolidated / Closure Gate Outcome). Previous Ecosystem Feedback tables (Tool Effectiveness / Configuration Adjustments / Issues to Report) were never filled by the activity.
- **compound template Axis 3** renamed from "Development Governance" to **"Competency Capitalization"** with tables aligned on activity §3 (Learning Notes / Competency Map / Proactive LEARN Proposals). Previous Governance tables (Decision Tier Review / Guardrail Effectiveness / Process Improvements) were never filled.
- **integrate.md Axe 2 `github.enabled: false` short-circuit** — previously absent. compound.md already respected `github.enabled: false` (export local only), but integrate would still try to submit any pending `.gse/compound-tickets-draft.yaml`. Integrate now checks `github.enabled` first and deletes the draft file if disabled (user's intent is clearly "export only").

### Added
- **methodology-feedback.md template** extended with Theme 2 scaffold block, separator convention (`---` between themes), **Totals** section (observations/themes/severity split/route), and **Next steps** section. Previously the template ended after Theme 1 with no closing — users had no guidance on formatting additional themes.
- **compound.md Step 5 `.gse/plan.yaml` handling clarified** with explicit "no-op" sub-step. The durable sprint-plan archive is `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/plan-summary.md` (produced by `/gse:deliver` Step 9.1 with `gse.id: PLN-NNN` inherited); `.gse/plan.yaml` itself stays in place with `status: completed` (sprint-freeze marker) until `/gse:plan --strategic` opens the next sprint and overwrites it. Eliminates the audit's concern about plan.yaml getting stranded after sprint-directory archival.

### Notes
- compound.md Step 5 sub-step numbering shifted from 4 to 6 due to the new "plan.yaml handling" sub-step between archive accessibility and dashboard regeneration.
- These fixes close the delivery/compound cluster audit findings except for the two reported items (LC02/LC03 documentation and backup tag format) that were the most material.

## [0.47.5] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (cross-cutting cluster pass)

**Methodology coherence pass — fifth batch** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Four cross-cutting defects around onboarding flow, artefact placement, mode-aware orchestration, and one upward refinement bringing design up to the implementation's quality.

### Fixed
- **`docs/intent.md` placement officialized** in spec §12.1 Project Layout. Previously, go.md wrote the artefact to `docs/intent.md` (top-level, correct since intent is project-level) but the spec's canonical layout diagram never mentioned it — artefact was effectively undocumented. Bonus: added `docs/sprints/sprint-NN/preview.md` (created in Prop 10) and `docs/archive/intent-vNN.md` (mentioned in §14.3 Step 5.7 pivot but absent from layout).
- **hug.md Step 4.2 now creates `config.yaml`** from the template when `.gse/` is scaffolded. Previously only `profile.yaml` was written, leaving `/gse:go` Step 6.3 (which writes `config.yaml.lifecycle.mode`) to crash on missing file. `checkpoints/` subdirectory also added explicitly.
- **health.md mode-awareness** added at the top of Step 1: Micro → skip entirely with Inform note; Lightweight → compute only the 3 dimensions mandated by spec §13.2 (`test_pass_rate`, `review_findings`, `git_hygiene`); Full → compute all 8. Frontmatter description updated to reflect the mode-dependent count.

### Changed
- **design §5.14 Step 2 decision tree** upgraded to plan.yaml-primary (mirrors go.md Step 3, which is the authoritative implementation). Previous table was file/status-based ("Sprint, tasks in-progress", "Sprint, tasks done, not reviewed") which predates the `plan.yaml.workflow.active` single source of truth. This is an **upward refinement** — the implementation was ahead of the design, now aligned.

### Notes
- No backward-compatibility break. Projects that already have `config.yaml` will not be overwritten — hug.md Step 4.2 creates it only if `.gse/` itself is being created.
- health.md mode branching assumes `config.yaml.lifecycle.mode` is populated. Older projects without this field default to Full behavior (backward compatible) — the agent should advise re-running `/gse:go` to set the mode explicitly.

## [0.47.4] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **spec**, **implementation**, **templates** (sprint lifecycle schema drift pass)

**Methodology coherence pass — fourth batch** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Targets sprint lifecycle schema inconsistencies: DEC destination drift, ghost TASK status value, branch_status enum split, missing sprint template, PREVIEW sequence formulation, and hardcoded sprint-01 placeholders.

### Added
- **`src/templates/sprint/preview.md`** template. Previously, `preview.md` activity wrote `preview_variant`, `scaffold_path`, and `Inform-tier Decisions` to a file with no template reference — each sprint invented the schema. The new template formalizes: gse: namespace with `preview_variant` / `scaffold_path` frontmatter; sections for UI, API, Architecture, Data, Feature Walkthroughs, Import previews; Inform-tier Decisions closure section.
- **MANIFEST.yaml** entry for `sprint/preview.md → docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/preview.md` (created_by: /gse:preview, scope: sprint).

### Fixed
- **DEC-NNN destination** in plan.md:50 corrected from `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/decisions.md` (sprint-local, not read by downstream) to `.gse/decisions.md` (canonical — template, MANIFEST, design all agree). Restores P6 traceability of decisions made during Open Questions Gate.
- **`status: ready` ghost value** removed from produce.md:91 selector. `ready` was not in the `backlog.yaml` enum (`open | planned | in-progress | review | fixing | done | delivered | deferred`) and no activity transitioned into it — dead code. Produce now selects only `status: planned`.
- **`branch_status` enum** in plan.md:163 aligned from `planned | created | merged | abandoned` to the canonical `null | planned | active | merged | deleted` (matches backlog.yaml template + produce.md + deliver.md + backlog.md — 4 out of 5 sources). `created` and `abandoned` were unused anywhere.
- **`micro` removed from plan-summary.md template mode line** (Micro mode has no plan.yaml, so plan-summary is never generated for Micro — the option was unreachable).
- **Sprint templates branch hardcoded `sprint-01`** replaced by placeholder `gse/sprint-{NN}/integration` across 6 files (reqs.md, design.md, tests.md, review.md, release.md, compound.md) with explicit "replaced at instantiation by /gse:<activity>" comment. Sprint 2+ artifacts now carry their correct sprint branch.

### Changed
- **PREVIEW in Full-mode sequence** reconciled across 3 documents. Previously: spec §14 treated PREVIEW as baseline always-included; plan.md §7 baseline excluded PREVIEW with "insert conditionally if domain ∈ {web, mobile}"; design §10.1 baseline excluded PREVIEW with "plus preview after design for web/mobile" addendum. Now all three agree on spec §14 semantics: **PREVIEW is in the Full-mode baseline sequence** `[collect, assess, plan, reqs, design, preview, tests, produce, review, deliver]`. At PLAN-time, when `project.domain ∉ {web, mobile}`, PREVIEW is moved to `workflow.skipped` with an explicit reason. Plan.md §7 and design §10.1 reformulated accordingly.
- **plan.md §7 "Conditional insertions"** renamed to "Conditional adjustments at PLAN-time" and clarified: PREVIEW is moved to skipped (not inserted), FIX is inserted after review (when findings exist).

### Notes
- MANIFEST.yaml now declares 21 templates (was 20). Grand totals in design §12 will reconcile the new template count in a future count-refresh pass.

## [0.47.3] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design** (structural cleanup pass)

**Methodology coherence pass — third batch (structural corrections)** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Targets dangling cross-references, missing TOC entries, undefined steps referenced multiple times, and one missing introduction section.

### Fixed
- **spec TOC** now lists Appendix B (Cost Assessment Grid for Maintenance Work) and Appendix C (Maintainer Guide) separately. Previous entry "B. Maintainer Guide" pointed at Appendix B but Appendix B is actually the Cost Grid — Maintainer Guide is Appendix C.
- **spec §14.3 "Step 6 (Complexity Assessment)"** now exists as a dedicated section. Previously referenced 4 times (§14.3 Step 2 tables, §13.2 cross-ref, Step 5 transition lines) but never defined. The new Step 6 consolidates the 8 structural signals scanned, the mode mapping (Micro / Lightweight / Full), and the Gate decision format.
- **spec §3.2.1 line 1123** corrected from "not 11" to "not 13" — the HUG interview has 13 dimensions (confirmed by spec §14.1 and the 13-row table in hug.md).
- **spec §7.2 Risk Alerts example** corrected `DS-002` → `DES-002`. `DS-` is not a canonical P6 prefix; design decisions use `DES-`.
- **spec §10 commit convention example** corrected `Traces: RVW-005, SEC-002` → `Traces: RVW-005, RVW-012`. `SEC-` is not a canonical P6 prefix; since Prop 7 unified all reviewer findings to `RVW-NNN` with `perspective:`, the example now reflects that.
- **design §1 Introduction** added. The document previously started at §2 (Plugin System Comparison), which disoriented readers. The new §1 clarifies scope, out-of-scope, and reading order.
- **design §5.14 ligne 1167** corrected cross-ref `Adopt mode (see 5.5)` → `Adopt mode (see 5.4)`. §5.4 is Adopt Mode; §5.5 is Lightweight Mode (different concept).
- **design §5.9 "Step 7 — (removed)"** dead section marker removed. The info it carried ("health auto-updated by canonical run") is already covered by its reference to spec §6.3.

### Notes
- No plugin impact — these are spec/design documentation corrections. Regeneration is a no-op.
- design §14 Open Questions status labeling (some items "RESOLVED", others "Recommendation" without status) is deliberately deferred to a future dedicated proposition — each row needs individual analysis.

## [0.47.2] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **spec**, **implementation** (schema + artefact identification pass)

**Methodology coherence pass — second batch** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Addresses profile.yaml schema drift (major — activities and agents were divided between two reading paths), QA severity scale harmonization across 6 reviewer agents, and sprint template artefact identification (IDs + frontmatter namespace).

### Fixed
- **profile.yaml root structure** split into `user: {name, git_email}` + `dimensions: {13}` (previously flat under `user:`). The split was already used by 8 consumers (plan, fix, coach×4, orchestrator×2) but contradicted by 4 (produce, tests, guardrail-enforcer, spec §1537). The 4 flat readers are now aligned on `dimensions.*`.
- **6 dimension enum values** aligned on `hug.md` Step 2 canonical interview spec: `scientific_expertise` → `practitioner` (was proficient), `abstraction_capability` → `concrete-first | balanced | abstract-first`, `preferred_verbosity` → `terse | normal | detailed`, `domain_background` → free text (was closed enum), `decision_involvement` → `autonomous | collaborative | supervised`, `team_context` adds `pair`.
- **project_domain enum fused** into 9 values: `web | api | cli | data | mobile | embedded | library | scientific | other` (combines hug's `api/data/other` and template's `library/scientific`).
- **learning_goals type** unified as list of strings (was `[]` in template, `"free text"` in hug.md example — incompatible).
- **contextual_tips / emoji** standardized on native YAML booleans `true/false` (hug.md example had `on/off` strings).
- **hug.md "12 HUG dimensions" → "13"** (table has 13 rows; spec §14.1 says "all 13").
- **learn.md `mother_tongue` → `language.chat`** (non-existent dimension corrected).
- **QA severity scale** harmonized on `HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW` (spec §6.5 canonical) across 6 reviewer agents: security-auditor (was CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), requirements-analyst, architect, test-strategist, ux-advocate, devil-advocate (all were CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO). CRITICAL is now reserved exclusively for the P15 "Verified but wrong" escalation applied at review merge time.
- **Finding ID format** unified to `RVW-NNN` with `perspective: <agent-name>` field across all 7 reviewer agents (previously each had own prefix: SEC-, REQ-, DES-, TST-, UX-, DEVIL-). Eliminates collisions with artefact IDs (REQ-, DES-, TST- are reserved for Requirements, Design decisions, Test specs per spec §P6).
- **sprint/review.md template** severity table: 6 rows (CRITICAL/HIGH/WARNING/MEDIUM/LOW/INFO) → 4 rows (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with note explaining CRITICAL is P15 escalation only.
- **Sprint template body IDs** aligned on canonical prefixes: reqs.md uses `REQ-001..REQ-099` (functional) and `REQ-101..REQ-199` (non-functional) — was `R01/R02/NFR01/NFR02/NFR03`. design.md uses `DES-001/DES-002` — was `D01/D02`. tests.md uses `TST-001..TST-009` (unit), `TST-010..TST-019` (integration), `TST-020..TST-029` (E2E), `TST-030..TST-039` (policy) — was `T01/T02/T10/T20/T30`.
- **Activity Persist step frontmatter** for reqs/design/tests aligned on orchestrator §331 `gse:` namespace (was flat `id/artefact_type/title/author`). Canonical traces fields: `derives_from`, `implements`, `tested_by`, `decided_by`. Removed non-canonical `implemented_by` (design.md) and `tests: [SRC-]` (tests.md).

### Changed
- **profile.yaml template** gains meta fields (`version: 1`, `inferred: {}`, `created`, `updated`) previously present in hug.md Step 5 example only. `expertise_domains` and `competency_map` unchanged (agent-populated, not asked at HUG).
- **hug.md Step 5 YAML example** updated to reflect new template shape (split structure, list learning_goals, bool flags, no `on/off` strings).
- **dashboard.py** profile reading simplified from `dimensions.X OR flat X` fallback to canonical `dimensions.X` only (both `it_expertise` and `decision_involvement`).
- **devil-advocate P15 escalation rules** rewritten to match the 3+1 tier structure: Moderate → one-level escalation (LOW→MEDIUM, MEDIUM→HIGH); Low → HIGH + user verification; Verified-but-wrong → CRITICAL (only path to CRITICAL).
- **test-strategist severity blocks** now document that `[STRATEGY] [TST-SPEC] [IMPL]` tags are orthogonal to severity (they identify review tier, not severity level).
- **sprint/design.md template traces** extended to 4 canonical fields (was 2: `derives_from`, `decided_by`; added: `implements`, `tested_by`).
- **Test level added to `gse:` namespace** (`gse.level: unit | integration | e2e | visual | performance | policy`) in tests.md activity Persist step.
- **Requirements references in design.md template** renamed from "Requirements: R01, R02" to "Implements: REQ-001, REQ-002" (aligns with canonical `implements` trace).

### Notes
- Not backward-compatible for old profile.yaml with flat structure (schema change; users must re-run `/gse:hug --update` after upgrade — or the agent auto-detects and migrates on first read, which is a TODO for a future minor).
- No activity, agent, or principle added/removed — only schema/descriptions harmonized.
- `git_email` kept as denormalization in `user:` for dashboard/coach read performance (source of truth remains `git config user.email`).

## [0.47.1] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (3-layer coherence pass)

**Methodology coherence pass — first batch** from the /gse-audit run against v0.45.0. Addresses 5 clusters of drift across spec, design, and src/ that had accumulated over the last minor versions (coach + deploy-operator added without propagating counts; opencode added without backfilling the design doc; activity-side writes using stale schema field names; checkpoint schema diverging from spec; template/descriptor confusion).

### Fixed
- **Agent count** — "8 specialized" updated to "10 specialized" (and "9 agents" → "11 agents") in spec §1.1.4, gse-one-implementation-design §3.1/§3.3/§6.4/§12, gse_generate.py docstrings/comments, and gse-one/README.md. The source-of-truth (SPECIALIZED_AGENTS list in gse_generate.py) was already correct; only descriptions were stale.
- **Template count** — "15" (spec) and "19" (design) replaced by the actual count of 28 artifact templates across spec §1.1.4, design §3.1/§3.3/§11.1/§12, gse_generate.py docstrings, and README. MANIFEST.yaml is now explicitly flagged as a descriptor (not itself a template).
- **Schema field `lifecycle_phase` → `current_phase`** across 9 source files (5 activities + orchestrator + checkpoint template + design text + go.md reading path). Spec §12.4, status.yaml template, and dashboard.py were already canonical; the drift was confined to activity-side writes/reads. Fixes a silent bug where /gse:compound and /gse:deliver wrote to a field the dashboard never read, leaving the phase display stuck at LC00.
- **design §12 inventory totals recomputed** — Shared 51→62, Grand total 57→150 (adding opencode-only column with 59 files counted correctly for the first time).

### Changed
- **design §6 Cross-Platform Parity** restructured to include opencode as a first-class platform (§6.3 "opencode: AGENTS.md Embedding" inserted, §6.4/§6.5 renumbered, §6 intro updated from "both platforms" to "all three supported platforms", §6.4 "Generation and Parity" extended to cover 3 outputs + 3-way body parity verification, §6.5 "Installer Differentiation" extended with opencode installer merging between GSE-ONE START/END markers).
- **design §7.3 Format Differences** adds an opencode column documenting native TS plugin delivery (`plugins/gse-guardrails.ts`) vs Claude/Cursor JSON hooks.
- **design §11.1 Generation Steps** extends each row to show all opencode outputs (opencode/skills/, opencode/commands/, opencode/agents/, opencode/AGENTS.md, opencode.json, gse-guardrails.ts).
- **design §13 Implementation Priorities** — added an introductory note stating the 4 phases document the original Claude+Cursor roadmap; opencode was a separate follow-up effort (v0.31+); fixed Phase 2 Step 15 from "8 agents + Cursor P14 always-on rule" to "10 specialized agents + Cursor orchestrator always-on rule".
- **checkpoint.yaml schema** refactored to flat top-level (no `checkpoint:` wrapper), zero duplication between checkpoint metadata and `status_snapshot` block, with explicit structured sub-blocks for `status_snapshot`, `backlog_sprint_snapshot`, and `git_state`. Obsolete duplicate fields removed: `checkpoint.sprint`, `checkpoint.phase`, `checkpoint.last_activity` (kept only in `status_snapshot` where they belong).
- **spec §12.5 and design §5.16 checkpoint schemas** updated to match the new flat + structured template schema (previously spec had `status_snapshot: <copy of status.yaml>` as a free string and used `git:` / `notes:`; now aligned with template: structured subblocks, `git_state:`, `note:` singular).
- **pause.md Step 2** — rewrote the checkpoint field mapping to reflect the flat schema (removed writes to obsolete `checkpoint.sprint`, `checkpoint.phase`, `checkpoint.last_activity` duplicates).
- **resume.md** — Step 1 --list display now references `status_snapshot.current_sprint/current_phase`; Step 5 fallback references `status_snapshot.last_activity` instead of non-existent `checkpoint.last_activity`.

### Notes
- Not backward-compatible for old `checkpoint-*.yaml` files (schema change). Checkpoints are short-lived session artifacts so this is acceptable; running a fresh /gse:pause after upgrading produces the new schema.
- No activity, agent, or principle was added or removed — only the descriptions counting them and the schema names used in their workflow text.
- All modifications applied after a deep audit using /gse-audit; the audit output is archived in _LOCAL/audits/ (gitignored).

## [0.47.0] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **tooling** (repo-level, not plugin)

**Audit reliability pass** — based on observations from the first full `/gse-audit` run against v0.45.0 (which produced 45 errors / 85 warnings / 31 recommendations spontaneously with excellent clustering, but revealed concrete gaps in the tool itself). Addresses: Python engine missing numeric drift in gse_generate.py, skill's save phase being too permissive, missing per-job completion tracking, absent finding→job traceability, and preservation of LLM-natural behaviors across future LLM versions.

### Added
- **`job_id` field** in the `Finding` dataclass (`gse-one/audit.py`) and in the agent's required output format (`methodology-auditor.md`). Python-engine findings carry `job_id="python-engine"`; each LLM sub-agent MUST tag its findings with its catalog `job.id`. This enables traceability (which job produced what) and filtered re-runs in future versions.
- **Per-job completion tracking** in Phase 4 aggregation: the orchestrator now records and reports "N/20 jobs completed" in the summary. Skipped or errored sub-agents are explicitly called out.
- **Table of Contents** at the top of the report (required when > 100 lines). Lists Summary, Clusters, Warnings, Info, Strategic recommendations per critique job, Conclusion.
- **Phase 5 quality requirements** section in the skill: documents 7 LLM-natural behaviors observed in real audits (thematic clustering, precise citations, strategic tables with Impact/Direction, fix-priority lists, files-to-consult-first, action-oriented phrasing, separation of immediate vs future horizons). Preserves quality against future LLM regression.

### Changed
- **`audit_numeric()` extended** to scan: spec, design, README, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, gse_generate.py, all activity files, all agent files. Previously only spec + design — missing 7 occurrences in `gse_generate.py`. Now also detects "N principles" drift (not just "N commands" and "N specialized"). Finding aggregation is per-file: one warning per (file, pattern, claimed_value) with all line numbers listed, instead of N warnings per N occurrences.
- **Filename format** for saved reports changed to `audit-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-vX.Y.Z.md` (was `audit-<ISO-timestamp>.md`). More readable, includes version for trace continuity across releases. Adopted from observed behavior in a spontaneous manual save by Claude Code.
- **Phase 6 save made MANDATORY** in the skill (was "unless --no-save"). Explicit procedure: mkdir → compute filename with VERSION + UTC date+time → Write 2 files (timestamped + latest.md) → verify via `ls` → report exact path to user. Rationale stated: audit trail is the primary value of running an audit.
- **Phase 4 aggregation** now prescribes thematic clustering of findings (Cluster 1 — Count drift, Cluster 2 — Schema drift, etc.) as a quality REQUIREMENT, not optional. Observed spontaneously by LLM in real runs; now codified so future LLMs don't regress.
- **Sub-agent prompt template** enriched: `job_id` field now REQUIRED in output, with explicit examples of all Finding fields (category, severity, location, file, detail, fix_hint, direction, impact).

### Notes
- A1 (actionable synthesis prescription), A2 (multi-location merging prescription), B2 (atomic fix commit suggestions) were considered but abandoned as redundant — the LLM produces these spontaneously with high quality. Phase 5 quality requirements capture the essence to prevent regression.
- C1 (impact-sorted recommendations) was already present in Principle 7 of the agent and naturally implemented by the LLM.
- `audit.py` total file count expanded from 6 to 7 scan targets (gse_generate.py + repo-level docs). Expected to catch ~2-3× more numeric drift findings.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **tooling** (repo-level, not plugin)

### Added
- **Automatic audit persistence** — `/gse-audit` slash command and `audit.py` CLI now save their reports to `_LOCAL/audits/` by default. Two files produced per run:
  - `_LOCAL/audits/audit-<ISO-timestamp>.md` — timestamped archive (one per run, accumulates)
  - `_LOCAL/audits/latest.md` — convenience copy, always overwritten (points to the most recent run)
  
  The `_LOCAL/` directory is gitignored (via `/_*/` in `.gitignore`), so audit history never leaks into commits. Forkers accumulate their own audit trail locally without polluting their repo.

- **`--no-save` flag** on `audit.py` and `/gse-audit` to disable persistence (stdout only).
- **`--save-to <path>` flag** for explicit output path (useful for CI artifact export or integration with external reporting).

### Changed
- **`gse-one/audit.py`** — default behavior is now to save + print. Previously: print only. Breaking change in default output, but opt-out via `--no-save` restores the old behavior.
- **`.claude/commands/gse-audit.md`** — new Phase 6 "Save the augmented report" documents the skill-side save (deterministic findings + LLM findings + strategic recommendations merged before persistence). The skill invokes `audit.py --no-save --format json` internally to avoid duplicate engine-side saves.
- **README "Auditing the plugin" section** — documents the new `_LOCAL/audits/` default, `latest.md` convenience, and save flags.

### Notes
- When the skill runs a full audit, only ONE file is saved (the augmented report). When `audit.py` is invoked standalone, its deterministic-only report is saved.
- Historical audits can be compared diffing two files under `_LOCAL/audits/`.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **tooling** (repo-level, not plugin)

**Tooling refactor** — massively expands `/gse-audit` with a declarative catalog of 20 parallel audit jobs spanning 5 categories, including 4 strategic critique jobs that empower the LLM to offer opinions on methodology design. No changes to the distributed plugin (spec, design, activities, agents, tools, templates all unchanged).

### Added
- **`.claude/audit-jobs.json`** — declarative catalog of 20 audit jobs across 5 categories:
  - A: File quality (2 jobs, non-directional)
  - B: Intra-layer uniformity (5 jobs, non-directional)
  - C: Layer pair spec ↔ design (1 job, bidirectional)
  - D: Horizontal clusters (8 jobs, bidirectional): governance, deploy, sprint-lifecycle, state-management, cross-cutting, coach-pedagogy, quality-assurance, delivery-compound
  - E: Strategic critique (4 jobs, bidirectional): methodology-design, ai-era-adequacy, user-value, robustness-and-recovery
- **`gse-one/audit_catalog.py`** — loader + validator (stdlib only). Validates schema, resolves globs, provides `find_job` / `is_file_in_cluster` helpers. CLI for inspection: `--list`, `--show <id>`, `--validate`.
- **Refinement taxonomy**: `none` (intra-file or intra-layer, no cross-level), `downward` (high level = reference), `bidirectional` (may propose upward corrections when lower level is better).
- **Bidirectional refinement Principle 6** in `methodology-auditor` agent: for `bidirectional` jobs, actively look for cases where implementation reveals a better formulation than design, or design a better formulation than spec. Propose upward updates.
- **Strategic critique Principle 7** in `methodology-auditor`: for Category E (`qualitative_critique`), the auditor is empowered to offer opinions and recommendations about methodology design itself. Severity `recommendation` (not error/warning/info). Each recommendation must include impact level (high/medium/low), rationale, alternative views.
- **New severity level `recommendation`**: distinct from error/warning/info. Never triggers CI exit codes. Reserved for Category E jobs.
- **Cluster-aware `audit.py`**: new flags `--cluster <id>` to filter findings to a specific catalog job, and `--list-clusters` to display all catalog entries.
- **Segmented report**: final output has two parts — **Part 1** coherence findings (Categories A-D), **Part 2** strategic recommendations (Category E).

### Changed
- **`.claude/commands/gse-audit.md`** rewritten as a parallel orchestrator: reads the catalog, spawns N sub-agents in ONE message (parallel via Agent tool calls), aggregates findings, renders segmented report. New flags: `--job`, `--category`, `--coherence-only`, `--strategic-only`.
- **`.claude/agents/methodology-auditor.md`** extended with Principles 6 (bidirectional refinement) and 7 (strategic critique). Output format now includes `direction` and `impact` fields.
- **`gse-one/audit.py`** `Finding` dataclass gained a `file` field for cluster-filtering support. Docstring updated with new flags.
- **README "Auditing the plugin" section** rewritten to reflect: 20 jobs in 5 categories, parallel execution, segmented report (coherence vs strategic), catalog customization workflow for forkers.

### Design decisions

1. **Why 5 categories (A-E) instead of merging A+B?** File-quality and intra-layer-uniformity serve different purposes: A audits individual files (can't be a group), B audits groups of same-level files (uniformity across a set). Keeping them distinct preserves clarity.

2. **Why `recommendation` as a separate severity?** Strategic critiques (Category E) are judgment-based and should never block CI. Keeping them separate from `error`/`warning` means they're surfaced as proposals, not defects.

3. **Why `bidirectional` default for cross-layer and Category E?** The refinement direction is normally downward (spec → design → impl), but the methodology may genuinely improve by recognizing cases where the implementation reveals a better abstraction than the spec captured. Allowing upward propositions keeps the methodology evolving.

4. **Why JSON catalog instead of YAML?** To stay within stdlib (Q4 validation). A forker can add a job without needing PyYAML.

### Notes for users
- End users who installed GSE-One for their project: unaffected. No new plugin command.
- Forkers: inherit all 20 jobs automatically via `git clone`. Add custom jobs by editing `.claude/audit-jobs.json`.
- CI integration: use `python3 gse-one/audit.py --fail-on error` (deterministic only; strategic recommendations never block).

## [0.44.0] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **tooling** (repo-level, not plugin)

**Tooling-only release** — adds a methodology coherence audit tool for maintainers and forkers of the gensem repository. No changes to the distributed plugin (spec, design, activities, agents, tools, templates all unchanged). The audit does NOT apply to user projects — for those, existing commands `/gse:status`, `/gse:health`, `/gse:review`, `/gse:assess`, `/gse:compound`, `/gse:collect` remain the right surface.

### Added
- **`.claude/commands/gse-audit.md`** — slash command for Claude Code, invokable as `/gse-audit` from the root of gensem or a fork. Orchestrates Phase 0 context detection + Phase 1 deterministic Python engine + Phases 2–3 LLM semantic reasoning + Phase 4 unified report.
- **`.claude/agents/methodology-auditor.md`** — specialized agent adopted during `/gse-audit`. Evidence-based, severity-classified, constructive, forker-respectful. Not part of the distributed plugin (local to repo).
- **`gse-one/audit.py`** — Python engine (stdlib-only, ~600 L). 12 deterministic categories: version consistency, file integrity, plugin parity, cross-file references, numeric consistency, link integrity, git hygiene, Python quality, template schema, TODO/FIXME scan, test coverage structural, last-verified freshness. CLI with `--format {md,json}`, `--category`, `--fail-on {error,warning}`. Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 errors, 2 warnings, 3 not-a-gensem-repo.
- **Optional PyYAML dependency** — `gse-one/audit.py` uses PyYAML if installed for YAML schema validation; skips gracefully with an info finding otherwise.
- **README section "Auditing the plugin"** — documents slash command + CLI access, 12 deterministic categories, 6 LLM dimensions, fork inheritance via `git clone`.
- **CLAUDE.md paragraph on `.claude/` repo-level tooling** — documents that maintainer tools live at `.claude/` or `gse-one/`, never in `gse-one/plugin/` (would pollute end-user distribution).

### Architecture rationale
The audit was deliberately placed **outside the plugin** for three reasons:
1. **Scope discrimination** — the plugin has 6 existing commands already covering user-project inspection (status, health, review, assess, compound, collect). Adding a 24th `/gse:audit` activity would create overlap and confuse end users.
2. **Forker ergonomics** — `.claude/` directories are inherited automatically via `git clone`. Forkers of gensem get the audit tool with zero install step.
3. **Maintainer-tool separation** — `.claude/` (repo-local) and `gse-one/audit.py` (alongside `gse_generate.py`) both clearly signal "maintainer only". The plugin distribution (`gse-one/plugin/`) remains focused on end-user methodology.

### Notes for users
- End users who installed GSE-One for their project are **unaffected**. No new command appears in `/gse:` autocomplete.
- Forkers automatically inherit `/gse-audit` in their fork's Claude Code session.
- CI integration (GitHub Actions running `audit.py --fail-on error`) is documented as future work.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation**, **tools**, **tests**, **docs**

### Added
- **Step -1 Orientation in `/gse:deploy`** — first-time users are greeted by a 4-option menu that identifies their role (Solo / Instructor / Learner / Skip). Each role triggers a tailored briefing (estimated duration, cost, next actions) before proceeding to Step 0. Integrated directly into `/gse:deploy` (single command to remember) rather than `/gse:hug`, for novice-friendly discoverability.
- **`user_role` field in `.gse/deploy.json`** — persists `"solo"`, `"instructor"`, `"learner"`, or `""` (if Skip/--silent). Purely informational in v1; no behavioral branching beyond Step -1.
- **`deploy.py record-role <role>`** subcommand — CLI handler invoked by the skill to persist the role with validation (VALID_ROLES = {solo, instructor, learner}).
- **`--silent` flag** on `/gse:deploy` — skips Step -1 entirely (for scripting, CI, or experienced users). Keeps all other Gates (costly operations, destroy confirmations).
- **Learner preconditions** — for role 3, the skill verifies (a) `.env.training` was copied to `.env`, (b) `DEPLOY_USER` is set, before proceeding. Exits with clear instructions if not.
- **5 new unit tests** (`RecordRoleTests`): empty-state shape includes `user_role`, record_role for each of 3 valid roles persists correctly, invalid role returns `status: "error"`. Total: 49 tests.

### Changed
- **`/gse:deploy --help`** reformatted with a "Who are you?" role-first narrative (3 paragraphs: Solo / Instructor / Learner) followed by the full Options table. Novices see their relevant flow first.
- **README "Deployment" section** simplified: the long 3-situations paragraph is replaced by a concise "Just run `/gse:deploy`" pointer to the Step -1 Orientation, plus the 4 role summary lines.
- **Spec §1.6 `/gse:deploy` row** extended to mention Step -1 and the `--silent` flag.
- **Design §5.18** new subsection "Onboarding orientation (Step -1)" documenting the trigger conditions, the 4-option menu, the role-based routing, and the `--silent` bypass.
- **`src/templates/deploy.json`** schema: added `user_role: ""` field between `last_updated_at` and `phases_completed`.
- **`plugin/tools/deploy.py`** — added `VALID_ROLES`, `record_role()`, CLI handler, subparser, and `user_role` to `_empty_state()`.

### Design decision
The onboarding was integrated directly into `/gse:deploy` (not into `/gse:hug`) because novices looking to deploy will naturally type the deploy command first. Separating onboarding from action would fragment the UX, especially for instructors briefing learners ("just run /gse:deploy" stays a one-sentence instruction). The slight entorse to the "onboarding = hug" convention is justified by significantly better discoverability and cohesion.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-04-21

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation**, **tools**, **tests**, **docs**

### Added
- **`/gse:deploy` production-ready.** Concrete, deterministic, auditable deployment activity for Hetzner Cloud + Coolify v4 (23rd command). Adaptive to solo / partial / training situations with 6-phase workflow (setup → provision → secure → install-coolify → configure-domain → deploy).
- **Subdomain derivation**: solo `<project>.<domain>`, training `<user>-<project>.<domain>` with full sanitization and RFC 1035 length checks.
- **Multi-application state schema**: `.gse/deploy.json` with `applications[]` array, Coolify hierarchy mapping (`gse` / `gse-<user>` projects + `production` environment), `cdn` block.
- **New artifact type `src/references/`**: reference material consulted by agents at runtime. Ships with `hetzner-infrastructure.md` (pricing, sizing, Coolify API endpoints, security checklist) and `ssh-operations.md` (connection patterns, credential resolution).
- **Four Dockerfile templates**: `Dockerfile.streamlit`, `Dockerfile.python`, `Dockerfile.node`, `Dockerfile.static` + shared `.dockerignore`. All include `ARG SOURCE_COMMIT=unknown` for Docker cache-bust.
- **`deploy-operator` agent**: 10th specialized agent, 7 core principles (safety, idempotence, user interaction, step numbering, error handling, credential management, SSH), 6-phase lifecycle, anti-patterns.
- **Python execution tools**: `plugin/tools/coolify_client.py` (Coolify v1 API HTTP client, stdlib-only, 3x retries on 5xx) + `plugin/tools/deploy.py` (orchestrator with 18 subcommands: state, env, subdomain, detect, preflight, record-*, deploy-app, destroy, wait-dns, training-*).
- **Concrete production-readiness**: 4 DNS registrar sections (Namecheap, Gandi, OVH, Cloudflare), Cloudflare CDN/DDoS/WAF proposal with 10-step opt-in flow, `ufw-docker` hardening (prevents Docker from bypassing UFW), detailed Coolify onboarding wizard, `wait-dns` polling with `@8.8.8.8` fallback resolver.
- **Training tools**: `--training-init` generates redacted `.env.training` (safe secrets only, security warning embedded), `--training-reap` deletes per-learner or all `gse-*` Coolify projects (preserves `gse` solo project).
- **Two-Gate `--destroy`** with dry-run preview, cost savings surfacing, retry-safe state preservation on partial failure, post-destroy warnings (DNS, Cloudflare, Let's Encrypt, SSH key).
- **Typed preflight**: `deploy.py preflight` subcommand returns type + port + 15+ structured checks (git state, entry points, Streamlit CORS/XSRF, Dockerfile `ARG SOURCE_COMMIT`, Node `start` script, Next.js build hint, static `index.html`).
- **Unit test foundation**: 44 stdlib unittest tests covering deterministic functions (sanitize, build_subdomain, detect_type, preflight rollup, env parsing, state I/O, cost hints). Runs automatically via `gse_generate.py --verify`.
- **`TESTING.md`** at `gse-one/` root: documents unit test runner + manual E2E checklist (solo full, solo partial, training, edge cases).
- **`--registrar <name>`, `--redeploy`, `--training-init`, `--training-reap`, `--help` flags** documented in skill `deploy.md`.
- **README "Deployment" section** with Prerequisites + "Maintaining upstream compatibility" contribution workflow (covers Coolify API, registrar UIs, hcloud install, Cloudflare UI, Coolify onboarding).
- **Abstraction principle doctrine** formalized in design §5.18: GSE-One prefers concrete, deterministic instructions over goal-level abstractions, for reproducibility, auditability, self-containment, testability.
- **Destroy semantics** documented: retry-safe, best-effort, dry-run supported, state preserved on partial failure.

### Changed
- **Design doc §5.18** expanded from an empty section to 12 subsections covering the full `/gse:deploy` design.
- **Spec §1.6 agent count corrected**: text said "8 specialized" while table listed 9. Now "10 specialized" (9 existing + deploy-operator) with matching table row.
- **Spec `/gse:deploy` row** options list extended to include all 7 flags (`--status`, `--redeploy`, `--destroy`, `--registrar`, `--training-init`, `--training-reap`, `--help`).
- **`src/templates/deploy.json`** redesigned: single `app` object → `applications: []` array, added `cdn` block, per-app Coolify UUIDs, resources.
- **`src/templates/config.yaml` `deploy.app_type`** extended to `auto | streamlit | python | node | static | custom`.
- **`src/templates/deploy-env-training.example`** enriched with URL pattern examples.
- **Generator `gse_generate.py`**: added `REFERENCES_DIR` + copy logic, extended tools verify, unit test runner in `--verify`, registered `deploy-operator.md` as 10th specialized agent.
- **Skill `deploy.md`** fully restructured (~600 lines): Step 0 delegates to tool `detect`, all phases persist completion via `record-phase`, Phase 6 consolidated into single `deploy-app` call, `--status`/`--destroy`/`--training-*` delegate to tool with skill-orchestrated Gates.

### Fixed
- **`destroy()` data-loss bug**: state was reset unconditionally even on partial failure, losing server tracking (user kept being billed with no trace in state). Now state is preserved on `status: "partial"` for retry.
- **Pre-existing spec inconsistency** (§1.6): text said "9 agents / 8 specialized" while table listed 9 specialized rows. Corrected to "11 agents / 10 specialized" with matching table.

### Removed
- **`src/templates/Dockerfile`** (old Streamlit-only default) — replaced by 4 specialized templates.
- **`gse-deploy-plan.md`, `gse-deploy-minimal-plan.md`** (design drafts at repo root) — archived outside the repo (`_LOCAL/archive/`, gitignored).

### Notes for contributors
The deploy implementation is deliberately concrete (not abstracted to LLM + Context7 MCP). Upstream drift (Coolify API, registrar UIs, hcloud install) is absorbed via PRs. See `README.md → Deployment → Maintaining upstream compatibility` and `TESTING.md`.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (templates, activities, generator)

### Added
- **Template `plan.yaml`** — authoritative schema for the living sprint plan (previously defined only inline in `plan.md`). All three layers (spec, design, activities) now reference this template as the single source of truth.
- **Template `decisions.md`** — decision journal header with unified DEC-NNN format (merged spec §11.2 Markdown format + design.md YAML traceability fields into a single Markdown format with 16 fields).
- **Template `checkpoint.yaml`** — session pause snapshot schema (previously defined only inline in `pause.md`).
- **Template `methodology-feedback.md`** — methodology feedback export format for COMPOUND Axe 2.
- **Template `MANIFEST.yaml`** — declarative index of all templates with target paths, creator activities, and scope. Prepares future `/gse:upgrade` and generator verification.
- **Section "Policy Tests"** in `sprint/tests.md` template — aligns template with v0.35.0 AMÉL-13 (policy test pyramid level, baseline 5%).
- **Section "Inform-tier Decisions"** in `sprint/design.md` template — aligns template with DESIGN Step 7 closure.
- **Section "Methodology Feedback Summary"** in `sprint/compound.md` template — aligns template with COMPOUND Step 2.6.

### Changed
- **`backlog.yaml` template** — replaced 2 example items (TASK-001, TASK-002) with empty list + commented structure. Added missing `delivered_at: null` field. Added `spike` to `artefact_type` enum.
- **`profile.yaml` template** — replaced orphan `competency_map` section (4 flat lists never read by any activity) with the rich `topics: {}` schema actually used by `/gse:learn` (level/last_session/mode/note per concept). Redirected `learn.md` to read/write `profile.yaml → competency_map.topics` instead of a separate `.gse/competency_map.yaml` file.
- **`status.yaml` template** — renamed `last_activity_date` → `last_activity_timestamp` (aligns with all 12 activities that write this field + dashboard.py that reads it). Fixed internal contradiction in orchestrator (line 465 said `_date`, line 485 said `_timestamp`).
- **Activities `plan.md`, `pause.md`** — replaced inline YAML schema blocks with references to authoritative templates + field population lists (eliminates schema duplication).
- **Activity `design.md`** — DEC-NNN format changed from YAML frontmatter (8 fields) to unified Markdown format (16 fields, merging spec consequence horizons + implementation traceability).
- **Spec §11.2** — enriched DEC-NNN example with `Activity`, `Traces`, `Status`, `Decided by` fields + renamed `Why` → `Rationale`.
- **Spec §12 tree** — `plan.yaml` description enriched with key fields summary + template pointer.

### Removed
- **`inventory.yaml`** — removed from the methodology. The artefact scan performed by `/gse:collect` is now ephemeral (console output only, not persisted to a file). `/gse:assess` runs its own inline scan instead of reading a stale file. Rationale: single consumer, immediately stale after any file change, redundant with git for file-level queries. The scan itself (Steps 1-5) and console summary remain unchanged.
- **`--refresh` flag** from `/gse:collect` — no longer meaningful without a persisted inventory file.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **documentation**

### Removed
- `docs/training-feedback-report.md` — pedagogical training-feedback report (added in v0.38.1) removed from the repository; it is now managed outside the repo.

## [0.38.1] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **documentation**

### Added
- **`docs/training-feedback-report.md`** — a pedagogical report (~20 pages, English) recapping the 20 improvements from the DLH training-feedback cycle. One card per AMÉL with uniform structure (problem / what we did / before-after / go further), a typed synthesis table (🛡 / 🔧 / 📐 / 🎯 / 🤝), sections on reshaped/deferred items and intentionally out-of-scope observations, plus release-chronology, glossary, and install annexes. Written without learner attributions; links point to commits and spec/design anchors.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **milestone** (no code / spec / design changes)

  Additional in-cycle fixes: v0.37.1 (`9198e4b`) generator `--clean` preserves `plugin/tools/`.

## [0.37.4] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **design**, **implementation** (generator, config template, integrate/compound, orchestrator)

### Fixed
- **Upstream repository URL corrected.** The hardcoded manifest URL pointed to `https://github.com/gse-one/gse-one` (non-existent) — replaced by the real upstream `https://github.com/nicolasguelfi/gensem` via a new `UPSTREAM_REPO` constant in `gse_generate.py` (single source of truth, propagated to all three manifests). Observed impact: `/gse:integrate` Axe 2 could not submit methodology feedback (learner10 training session hit the dead URL).
- **opencode manifest gained the repository field.** `opencode.json` now carries `gse.repository` alongside `gse.version`, so `/gse:integrate` Axe 2 works uniformly on opencode. Previously the Axe 2 flow was silently disabled on opencode because the methodology mandated reading `plugin.json → repository`, a file absent on that platform.

### Added
- **User-level override for the feedback target** — new `github.upstream_repo` field in `config.yaml` (default empty). When set, it takes precedence over the plugin manifest. Supports private forks, corporate issue trackers, and training-environment redirections without editing the shipped plugin.
- **Formal resolution order** for Axe 2 documented in `orchestrator.md`, `integrate.md`, `compound.md`, and `gse-one-implementation-design.md`: (1) `config.yaml → github.upstream_repo` if set, (2) plugin manifest (`plugin.json → repository` on Claude/Cursor, `opencode.json → gse.repository` on opencode), (3) skip Axe 2 with an Inform note.
- **Privacy acknowledgment strengthened in the final submission Gate.** The Gate before `gh issue create` now states explicitly that issues are public and visible to anyone with repo access, surfacing consequences before submission (P4 consequence visibility).

### Rationale
Learner10 deferred methodology feedback during `/gse:integrate` because the repo URL failed to resolve. Initial analysis proposed adding a new `upstream.issues_url` field, but a critical relecture found that the `repository` field already existed in plugin manifests and was referenced by the methodology — the real problems were (a) a hardcoded wrong URL in the generator, (b) opencode missing the field entirely, and (c) no user-facing override for environments where the default target isn't appropriate. Alt. B — fix the three defects without duplicating existing infrastructure — was preferred to Alt. A (new field) to avoid semantic duplication with `repository`. The override field (`github.upstream_repo`) addresses the remaining methodological gap: users can redirect feedback without patching shipped files.

## [0.37.3] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **design**, **implementation** (`/gse:preview` scaffold-as-preview variant)

### Added
- **Connectivity preflight before invoking any external scaffolder** in `/gse:preview` scaffold-as-preview variant (AMÉL-19 from training feedback). Before running a scaffold command (`create-next-app`, `create-vite`, `streamlit init`, …), the agent issues a short, ecosystem-appropriate reachability probe to confirm the registry is reachable from the current environment. **The exact probe command is left to the coding agent's judgment** based on the detected ecosystem — the methodology specifies the principle (what to verify, when), not the command (how). On probe failure, the agent does NOT retry the scaffold command: it presents a **4-option Gate** — *(1) Retry*, *(2) Run locally, then resume*, *(3) Fallback to static preview*, *(4) Discuss*. Option 2 prints the exact scaffold command, the user runs it in their own terminal, confirms completion, and the agent resumes from the created directory.
- Design doc fail-modes section now distinguishes *scaffolder invocation fails* (covered by the preflight + Gate) from *scaffold build fails* (already covered) — two independent fail modes with independent resolutions.

### Rationale
Training feedback observed learner10 (v01 Codex) hitting a sandbox/proxy block on `registry.npmjs.org` during `create-next-app`; the agent retried three times identically before the user manually granted broader network access (~5 minutes of blind-retry pantomime). The methodology provided no anchor for the fail case of *invocation* — only for the fail case of *build*. Adding a lightweight, principle-level preflight (no commands prescribed, no timeout prescribed, no config field) closes the gap without overreaching to other activities (`/gse:produce` dep installs, `/gse:tests` framework installs) on the basis of a single observation. If additional signals emerge, the pattern extends naturally. A separate, broader concern — *agents looping on any external operation that fails* — is noted for potential AMÉL follow-up (generic loop/blockage monitoring, potentially an extension of P16 Root-Cause Discipline).

## [0.37.2] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **implementation** (`architect` agent + `/gse:design` Step 2)

### Added
- **Framework isolation check in the `architect` agent** (AMÉL-18 from training feedback). New **Priorities** entry and new **Checklist** item ("Framework isolation") invoked during `/gse:design` and `/gse:review`. When the design includes a heavy UI or I/O framework (Streamlit, React, Next.js, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Express, Spring, …) AND non-trivial business logic, the agent proposes a framework-free domain module (`src/domain/**` imports stdlib only) and flags a DEC + a policy test enforcing the import boundary. Skipped when `config.yaml → project.domain ∈ {cli, library, scientific, embedded}` or when the design does not reference a UI/I/O framework.
- New `DES-004 [INFO] — Framework isolation opportunity` example in the agent's Output Format, showing the canonical finding (location, detail, DEC name, policy-test hint).
- One-line guideline in `/gse:design` Step 2 (Component Decomposition) pointing to the architect checklist so the rule is visible in the workflow, not only inside the agent file.

### Rationale
Training feedback observed two learners (05, 06) adopting the framework-free domain pattern **spontaneously** to satisfy reversibility/quality-fit trade-offs (e.g., Streamlit app with `logic/budget.py` kept free of Streamlit imports). Learner05 explicitly requested promotion to a GSE-level guideline. A dedicated **principle P17** was considered but rejected: the pattern is a corollary of existing principles (Dependency direction, Separation of concerns, Layering violations) rather than a transversal invariant, and it is conditional on the project type — elevating it to a P-level rule would break the universality of P1–P16. Enriching the `architect` agent (already invoked at DESIGN and REVIEW) is minimal, conditional, and carries the recommendation exactly where it applies, with infrastructure (DEC + policy test from v0.35) already in place.

## [0.37.1] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **implementation** (generator)

### Fixed
- **Generator `--clean` no longer wipes `plugin/tools/`.** The previous `shutil.rmtree(PLUGIN)` erased the hand-maintained `plugin/tools/` directory, which is the only subtree not regenerated from `src/` (per `CLAUDE.md`). Running `gse_generate.py --clean` silently deleted runtime-critical scripts like `dashboard.py` — discovered when a commit-in-progress showed `dashboard.py` as deleted. `--clean` now iterates `plugin/`'s children and skips `tools/`.
- **Hard verify check for `plugin/tools/dashboard.py`.** `verify()` now fails with a non-zero exit and an explicit error when the dashboard script is missing, instead of producing only a silent `WARNING`. Any future accidental deletion is surfaced immediately in CI.

### Rationale
The bug was latent: the generator's `--clean` flag assumed `plugin/` was fully reproducible from `src/`, but `plugin/tools/` is a deliberate asymmetry. Encoding the asymmetry directly in the clean logic (rather than only in documentation) removes the footgun. The hard verify check is defense-in-depth — if `plugin/tools/dashboard.py` disappears for any other reason (mis-merge, human error), the next `--verify` run catches it.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (tutor agent merged into unified `coach` agent)

### Changed
- **Tutor agent merged into unified `coach` agent** (AMÉL-16 from training feedback). The v0.36 `tutor` and the earlier proto-`coach` observation concern are now a single specialized sub-agent (`agents/coach.md`) observing the AI+user collaboration along **8 axes** grouped into two categories:
  - **Pedagogy** (axis 1, ex-tutor): explicit `learning_goals` + inferred competency gaps → 5-option P14 preambles, LRN- learning notes.
  - **Workflow** (axes 2–8): profile calibration (HUG drift), sprint velocity, workflow health, quality trends, engagement pattern (P16 acceptance/pushback), process deviation, sustainability (session cadence).
- **Per-axis toggles** in `config.yaml → coach.axes.*` — users disable what's irrelevant (e.g., sustainability off for async solo work, engagement off when P16 is already visible enough). Master switch `coach.enabled` and per-invocation caps (`max_preambles_per_sprint`, `max_advice_per_check`) preserved.
- **Invocation contract** — orchestrator passes a `moment` tag (`activity_start:/gse:*`, `sprint_close`, `mid_sprint_stall`, `gate_sequence_end`, `activity_skip_event`, `session_boundary`, `compound_axe_3`, `inferred_gap_trigger`, `profile_drift_recurrence`); coach returns zero or more YAML blocks (`skip | propose | advise`) materialized as P14 Gates (pedagogy) or Inform/Gate lines (workflow).
- Specialized-agent count unchanged at 9 — `tutor.md` removed, `coach.md` added.

### Added
- **`profile_drift_signals{}` field** in `status.yaml` — persistent map of HUG-profile drift observations, debounced across sessions, consumed by profile-calibration axis at `/gse:compound` Axe 3 to propose `/gse:hug --update`.
- **`workflow_observations[]` field** in `status.yaml` — transient scratchpad for velocity/health/quality/engagement/deviation/sustainability observations during the sprint, cleared at sprint close after consumption by compound.
- **Coaching recipes section** in `agents/coach.md` — extensible, tagged `for: pedagogy | workflow | both`, dual-maintenance (user-editable + agent-updatable via `/gse:compound` Axe 3). Replaces the v0.36 tutor "Pedagogical recipes" section with broader scope.

### Removed
- `gse-one/src/agents/tutor.md` (content absorbed into `coach.md`).
- `pedagogy:` section in `config.yaml` templates (replaced by `coach:` section with the same defaults plus per-axis toggles).
- *Tutor agent — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` (replaced by *Coach agent — Design Mechanics* covering all 8 axes).

### Rationale
Both the tutor (pedagogy) and the proto-coach (workflow monitoring) read from overlapping signal sources — `profile.yaml`, `status.yaml` history, activity transitions, P16 counters. Keeping them as two separate agents duplicates the signal-reading layer and splits extensibility (two recipes files, two sets of toggles, two invocation contracts). A single unified agent holds the full observational picture in one fresh-context invocation, exposes a single extensibility surface (recipes tagged per axis), and lets users turn observation on/off dimension by dimension rather than all-or-nothing. The 8-axis framing makes the agent's mandate legible while preserving P14 pedagogy semantics bit-for-bit (same 5-option gate, same persistence fields, same anti-spam caps).

## [0.36.0] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (new agent + orchestrator + config/status templates + generator)

### Added
- **New `tutor` specialized agent** (AMÉL-15 from training feedback) — dedicated sub-agent managing user upskilling along two axes: (1) explicit `learning_goals` from HUG, (2) inferred competency gaps detected from friction patterns (repeated questions, hesitations, explicit confusion, shotgun-fix correlation with P16 root-cause counter). Delivers P14 knowledge transfer via contextual evaluation + 5-option P14 preambles with precise, context-aware topic formulation (e.g., "property-based testing specifically relevant to the state invariants in your design" — not just "testing"). Architecture consistent with the other advocates (architect, security-auditor, ux-advocate, devil-advocate). Count of specialized agents: 8 → 9.
- **Pedagogical evaluation invariant in the orchestrator** — at activity start, if `learning_goals` is non-empty AND `pedagogy.enabled: true` AND sprint cap not exhausted, the orchestrator spawns the tutor for contextual evaluation. Tutor returns skip (silent) or propose with a topic and 5-option preamble content.
- **Extensible pedagogical recipes in `agents/tutor.md`** — a dedicated section users can edit manually AND the agent can auto-update via `/gse:compound` Axe 3 when a presentation strategy proves effective. Examples seeded: concrete-first preference, abstract-first preference, methodology self-improvement topics.
- **New `pedagogy` config section** (`config.yaml`): `enabled` (boolean, default true), `max_preambles_per_sprint` (cap, default 3), `proactive_gap_detection` (boolean, default true — monitors friction patterns to infer gaps).
- **New `learning_preambles[]` and `detected_gaps[]` fields** in `status.yaml` — persistent history of tutor interactions (respects `not-interested` permanently and `not-now` per-activity) and inferred-gap ledger reviewed at `/gse:compound` Axe 3.
- New *Tutor agent — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` with invocation contract, inputs/outputs, persistence model, and dual-maintenance rules for pedagogical recipes.
- `tutor.md` added to `SPECIALIZED_AGENTS` list in `gse_generate.py` so it is copied to the three platform targets (Claude skills, Cursor, opencode).

### Rationale
Observed training feedback (learner05): *"Consider making this an auto-propose behaviour when `profile.learning_goals` intersects with the next activity. Currently it's ad-hoc — formalising would remove guesswork."* After analysis, a static `goal → activity` lookup table is too rigid (misses precise goals, orthogonal goals, abstract goals, task-content-driven goals). A dedicated **tutor agent** performs contextual evaluation instead: objective (fresh context), precise (topic tied to what the activity will actually exercise), extensible (pedagogical recipes file), non-saturating (caps, persistence of user choices). Pattern consistent with the other specialized advocates.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (test pyramid + tests activity)

### Added
- **Policy tests as a first-class pyramid level** (AMÉL-13 from training feedback). New "Policy" column in the spec §6 test pyramid (5% baseline across all domains, raisable to 10-15% for strict-architecture projects). Policy tests enforce **structural rules** on the codebase via static analysis: architecture layering (e.g., `src/domain/** must not import src/ui/**`), license compliance (`no GPL dependency`), naming conventions, file-size limits, docstring requirements, dependency rules.
- New *Policy tests — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` with tooling suggestions per language (`pytest-archon`, `grimp`, `ts-arch`, `dependency-cruiser`, `ArchUnit`, `go-arch-lint`, `cargo-deny`, `license-checker`, etc.) and the rationale for making Policy first-class rather than a subset of Other.
- New *Policy test derivation* section in `/gse:tests` Step 1 — automatic scan of `design.md` (Architecture Overview / Component Diagram / Shared State) and `decisions.md` (DEC- entries with architectural intent) to propose policy tests as Inform-tier suggestions. Each accepted proposal becomes a TST-NNN with `level: policy` and `traces: { enforces: [DEC-NNN, ...] }`.
- Distinction clarified: **Policy** = purely structural (static scan, no runtime); **Other** = dynamic-constraint checks attached to behavioral tests (accessibility, performance, compatibility, hardware simulation, data quality).

### Changed
- Spec §6.1 pyramid table: Policy column inserted before Other. Unit and Other percentages lightly rebalanced across all 8 domains to make room for Policy's 5% baseline. Totals preserved.
- `/gse:tests` command description in spec §3 now mentions Policy as a covered test level.
- `/gse:tests --strategy` Step 1 description updated: test strategy is now derived from **three sources** (validation from REQS, verification from DESIGN, policy from DESIGN+DECISIONS structural rules).

### Rationale
Observed training feedback (learner05): *"Policy tests don't fit the unit/integration/e2e pyramid. These are real tests that guard the codebase's shape, not its behaviour. Promote to a first-class level."* Matches observed industry practice in mature codebases (ArchUnit in Java, ts-arch in TypeScript, pytest-archon in Python). Making Policy explicit in the pyramid forces honest budgeting at strategy time and surfaces the architecture-enforcement concern that would otherwise stay invisible.

## [0.34.1] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **spec**, **implementation** (activity preview — documentation clarification only, no new mechanism)

### Added
- **Sprint-level skip condition for PREVIEW** (AMÉL-11 from training feedback, documentation clarification). When the current sprint contains no task producing a user-visible or demonstrable artefact (foundation sprints doing infrastructure, reqs, design, tests only), PREVIEW is legitimately skipped. Recorded in `plan.yaml → workflow.skipped` with reason *"no user-visible tasks in this sprint — preview will apply in a future sprint when demonstrable work is scheduled"*. Standard skip, no DEC- created.
- Explicit anti-pattern documented: **preview-ahead is NOT supported**. Tasks scheduled for future sprints must not be previewed during the current sprint's PREVIEW. Rationale: staleness risk if target scope evolves, blurred sprint boundaries, traceability disruption. PREVIEW is just-in-time.

### Changed
- `/gse:preview` Step 1 enriched with the skip condition and the anti-preview-ahead rule.
- Spec §3 `/gse:preview` command description mentions the skip and the anti-preview-ahead rule.

### Rationale
Observed training feedback (learner05): *"PREVIEW in a foundation-only sprint is semantically odd — there's no UI code in Sprint 1 to preview. Solution: preview the Sprint 2 screens during Sprint 1."* After analysis, the just-in-time principle is more aligned with the methodology than preview-ahead: each sprint runs its own PREVIEW when it contains the tasks concerned. The skip is the clean, faithful answer — zero new mechanism introduced.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-04-20

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (P10 principle + activity plan + config template)

### Added
- **Semantic redefinition of the complexity point** (AMÉL-10 from training feedback). One complexity point now officially measures **coupled effort and complexity for the AI + user pair**: code complexity added + AI generation effort + human review effort, treated as a single scalar because these dimensions are entangled in practice.
- **Indicative temporal anchor**: 1 point ≈ 1 pair-session hour (AI generation + user review + decision). A 10-point sprint ≈ 1-3 working days with AI, or ~1-2 weeks for a solo human without AI (speedup ratio typically 10×, varying 5-20× by domain — CRUD-standard ~15-20×, algorithmic / research ~3-5×). The anchor is **indicative, not prescriptive** — spec §2 "Sprint = complexity-boxed, no fixed duration" is preserved.
- **Appendix B in spec: Cost Assessment Grid for Maintenance Work** — four-criteria grid (fan-out, review burden, rework risk, coupling) yielding 0 / 1 / 2-5 pt for refactoring, tests, docs, renaming, bug-fixing. Replaces the pre-v0.34 "zero-cost items" blanket rule that underestimated maintenance load.
- Full definition propagated to: spec §2 P10, spec §8.1 Concept, spec glossary (2 entries), P10 principle file (new "Definition of a complexity point" + "Temporal anchor (indicative)" sections), config.yaml template (enriched comment), design doc §5.17 "Complexity budget ranges" mechanics note.

### Changed
- **`/gse:plan` sizing scale** — the S/M/L letter scale (S=1, M=3, L=5) is abandoned. Tasks are now sized directly in integer complexity points (typically 1-6 from the P10 cost table). Rationale: the letter scale required a mental translation step between two coexisting scales (learner05 training feedback); with the new semantic unifying complexity + effort in a single unit, the letter scale became redundant.
- **P10 principle rule 8** replaced: the "zero-cost items" blanket (refactoring / tests / docs / bug fixes / removals = 0 pt always) becomes a case-by-case judgment using the new Appendix B grid. Removing code / dependencies remains a simplification credit (negative points) regardless of scale.
- Spec §8.1 and glossary entries updated with the temporal anchor and the new definition.
- `config.yaml` template comment for `complexity.budget_per_sprint` now explains the pair-effort semantics and the indicative temporal anchor.

### Preserved
- Sprint = complexity-boxed, no fixed duration (spec §2). The temporal anchor is a calibration aid, not a deadline.
- P10 cost table values (1-6 pt per decision type) unchanged — only the semantic interpretation is enriched.
- Simplification credit rule — unchanged.
- Default budget values — config.yaml defaults to 10 pt/sprint; spec §8 recommendations remain 15/12/8 for foundation/feature/stabilization sprint types.
- Backward compatibility — existing `complexity: 3` in backlog.yaml files is valid as-is with the enriched interpretation.

### Fixed
- Translation friction observed in training session learner05 ("Two scales coexist [P10 fine-grained and S/M/L] which took a mental translation step"). One unit now — complexity points with a pair-effort semantic.
- Underestimation of sprint load when the sprint is mostly maintenance (previously zero-cost under the blanket rule). The grid forces honest sizing.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (activities preview + produce)

### Added
- **Scaffold-as-preview** as an officially-supported PREVIEW variant (AMÉL-09 from training feedback). New Step 1.5 "Preview Variant Selection" Gate at the start of `/gse:preview` lets the user pick between:
  - **(1) static description** — wireframes, ASCII diagrams, user story walkthroughs written into `preview.md` (default for API / CLI / library / scientific / data previews).
  - **(2) scaffold-as-preview** — minimal runnable project using the chosen framework (Vite+React, Streamlit, Next.js, etc.) that becomes the base for the following `/gse:produce`. Placeholder code marked with `PREVIEW:` comments (language-idiomatic: `//`, `#`, `<!-- -->`, `/* */`). Build evidence: exit 0 on the framework's build command.
- **Agent recommendation** per project domain (web/mobile → scaffold recommended; api/cli/library/scientific → static recommended).
- **`PREVIEW:` comment convention** documented: each marker must include a descriptor explaining what will replace it, ideally with a TASK- reference.
- **`/gse:produce` Step 1 scan** — when the sprint used scaffold-as-preview, a grep-based Inform-tier scan of residual `PREVIEW:` markers is presented at task selection as a visibility cue (not a guardrail).
- **`preview_variant` and `scaffold_path` fields** added to the preview artefact frontmatter for traceability.
- New *Preview Variants — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` detailing when each variant applies, the comment convention per language family, and integration with PRODUCE.
- `/gse:preview` command description in spec §3 updated to mention the two variants.

### Scope for v0.33
- Scaffold-as-preview applies only to UI and feature walkthrough preview types. API / architecture / data model / import previews remain static (they describe concepts that don't benefit from a runnable scaffold).

### Fixed
- Silent scaffold-as-preview improvisation observed in training sessions (learner05 justified it as DEC-011 methodology deviation; learner06 and learner10 did it implicitly without formal documentation). The pattern is now a first-class variant with a clear contract, preventing the "is this a deviation?" ambiguity.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (activity design + sprint template)

### Added
- **Shared State section in design artefact** (AMÉL-06 from training feedback) — The sprint design template (`gse-one/src/templates/sprint/design.md`) gains a new mandatory `## Shared State` section between Data Model and Technology Choices. Each entry captures: name (conceptual), scope (components/pages), mechanism (framework-appropriate storage + sync), rationale (one sentence), traces (REQ IDs). When no shared state applies, an explicit disclaimer line is mandatory — empty section is not permitted.
- **New Step 2.5 "Shared State Identification"** in `/gse:design` between Component Decomposition and Interface Contracts. Walks through component pairs and asks whether each reads/writes state that must stay consistent. Populates the design artefact's Shared State section with an algorithm, examples, and domain-adapted expectations (web/mobile: 1-5 entries typical; CLI/library: often zero; API: request context, session).
- New *Shared State — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md`.
- `/gse:design` command description in spec §3 updated to mention shared state identification.

### Fixed
- Silent duplication of state across components (training session learner06: 3 independent Streamlit month widgets instead of one shared `st.session_state["selected_month"]`, despite REQS stating "filter by month on all pages"). The design artefact now formalizes shared state as a first-class decision, surfacing the question at DESIGN time rather than after the fact.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (activities compound/integrate + config template)

### Added
- **Methodology feedback routing via `/gse:compound` Axe 2** (AMÉL-14 from training feedback). Instead of introducing a new `/gse:journal` skill, the existing `/gse:compound` Axe 2 is enriched with a closure Gate offering three options: *(1) Export as a local feedback document only* (produces `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/methodology-feedback.md` — shareable markdown, no GitHub interaction), *(2) Propose GitHub tickets* (quality-filtered, theme-grouped, deduplicated, capped by `compound.max_proposed_issues_per_sprint`, each validated by the user individually), *(3) Both*. Users who opt out of upstream feedback (no `github.repo` configured) only see option 1.
- New `compound.max_proposed_issues_per_sprint` config field (default: **3**) — hard cap to prevent upstream ticket spam. Excess themes consolidate into the local export.
- Quality rules for ticket proposals: concrete (cites at least one specific example), theme-grouped (one ticket per theme), deduplicated via `gh issue list` (fallback: "dedup unverified" marker), capped, user-validated per ticket.
- `.gse/compound-tickets-draft.yaml` handoff file between COMPOUND and INTEGRATE Axe 2 — ensures tickets are validated at COMPOUND, then submitted at INTEGRATE without re-opening the choice.
- New *Methodology Feedback — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md`.
- Sources scanned by Axe 2: RVW findings tagged `[METHOD-FEEDBACK]`, DEC- entries with `type: methodology-deviation`, `status.yaml → activity_history[*].notes`, and agent conversation memory.

### Changed
- Spec §3 `/gse:compound` command description updated to reference the 3-option Gate.
- Spec §2 P14 Methodology self-improvement section rewritten to describe the new flow (local export + curated tickets + quality rules).
- `/gse:compound` Step 2 (Axe 2) fully rewritten with explicit sub-steps: gather observations → synthesize themes → closure Gate → local export / ticket Gate / persist summary.
- `/gse:integrate` Step 2 (Axe 2) rewritten to consume the draft file produced by COMPOUND, with a final confirmation Gate and cleanup on successful submission.

### Fixed
- Ad-hoc student-notes improvisation observed in training session learner05 (participant manually requested and structured a `docs/student_notes.md`). The formalized COMPOUND Axe 2 export now provides a first-class path for this feedback without introducing a new skill or daily-journaling mechanism. Quality cap prevents the ticket-pollution anti-pattern when feeding upstream.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (orchestrator + activities produce/task)

### Added
- **Config Application Transparency** (AMÉL-12 from training feedback) — Every activity that materializes a `config.yaml` field with user-visible consequences (creates files/directories, modifies git state, enforces hard thresholds, changes delivery behavior) MUST emit a one-line Inform note at the moment of materialization. Format: `"Config applied: <field> = <value> (<origin> — to change: /gse:hug --update or edit .gse/config.yaml)"`. Origin computed at display time by comparing current value to the methodology default. Adapted to P9 for beginners (plain-language translation). Pure Inform-tier discipline — no Gate, no new state, no interruption. Prevents the surprise pattern where users discover unexpected behavior (e.g., worktree directories) after the fact.
- New paragraph in spec P7 (Risk-Based Decision Classification) documenting the general discipline.
- New *Config Application Transparency — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` with the standard format, origin classification algorithm, beginner adaptation, and extension pattern.
- New *Config Application Transparency Discipline* section in the orchestrator.

### Changed
- `/gse:produce` Step 2 (Git Setup) — adds the Inform note before creating the first branch or worktree, covering the three `git.strategy` values (worktree / branch-only / none) with appropriate wording for each.
- `/gse:task` Step 4 (Git Setup) — same pattern, deduplicated within a sprint via `status.yaml → last_activity` trail.

### Scope for v0.30
- Covered: `git.strategy` materialized by `/gse:produce` and `/gse:task`. Directly addresses the training feedback (learner05: surprise worktree creation).
- Extension path documented — future materializations (e.g., `testing.coverage.minimum` at `/gse:tests`, `git.tag_on_deliver` at `/gse:deliver`) follow the same pattern by adding the Inform line to their relevant step.

### Fixed
- Silent application of `git.strategy` default observed during training session learner05 (pragmatic deviation from config logged as DEC-015 after the fact). The Inform note now surfaces the choice and its origin at the moment of action, without requiring a Gate.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (orchestrator + 5 activities + intent template)

### Added
- **Open Questions mechanism — first-class concept** (AMÉL-08 + AMÉL-07 retrofit) — Ambiguities raised in artefacts are now structured entries with a full schema: `id` (new prefix `OQ-`), `question`, `resolves_in` (ASSESS | PLAN | REQS | DESIGN), `impact` (scope-shaping | behavioral | architectural | cosmetic), `status`, provenance (`raised_at`), and on resolution `resolved_at`, `resolved_in`, `answer`, `answered_by`, `confidence`, `traces`. Schema formalized in spec P6.
- **Activity-entry scan (transversal rule)** — The four lifecycle activities `/gse:assess`, `/gse:plan`, `/gse:reqs`, `/gse:design` each begin with a new **Step 0 Open Questions Gate** that scans `docs/intent.md` and the current sprint's artefacts for pending `OQ-` whose `resolves_in` matches the current activity. Resolutions are recorded in place (origin artefact updated, status flipped).
- **Scope-resolve absorbed as `/gse:plan` Step 0** — No separate `/gse:scope` skill is introduced. Open questions tagged `impact: scope-shaping` with `resolves_in: PLAN` are resolved at the beginning of `/gse:plan --strategic`, before item selection. Respects P5 (planning transversality) and keeps the catalog at 23 activities.
- **Mode-calibrated interaction via `decision_involvement`** — The Open Questions Gate behavior adapts to the HUG profile field: `autonomous` (agent pre-answers, Gate only for high-impact), `collaborative` (per-question Gate with agent proposal, default), `supervised` (neutral Gate, no pre-answer). Reuses existing infrastructure — no new mode concept introduced.
- New `OQ-` prefix added to spec P6 traceability table, `Open Question` glossary entry, `Activity-entry scan` glossary entry.
- New **Open Questions Resolution Invariant** section in the orchestrator listing concerned activities, scan mechanics, and mode behavior.
- New **Open Questions Resolution — Design Mechanics** subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` detailing source enumeration, markdown format (human-readable bullet list with sub-fields), parsing rules, recording format, scope-shaping propagation, and failure modes.

### Changed
- **Retrofit AMÉL-07 terminology** — The informal term `natural home` introduced in v0.28 is **renamed to `resolves_in`** across all artefacts (spec, design, orchestrator, template, go.md) and given a formal schema. The valid values are now `ASSESS | PLAN | REQS | DESIGN` (previously included the informal `scope-lock`, which is removed — scope-resolve is folded into PLAN Step 0).
- `gse-one/src/templates/intent.md` — Open Questions section rewritten as structured markdown entries (not plain bullet list), consumable by the activity-entry scan.
- `/gse:go` Step 7 Intent Capture — updates the wording to reflect the new `resolves_in` / `impact` fields.
- `/gse:plan --strategic` Step 0 renamed from "Previous Sprint Analysis" to "Open Questions Gate" (now primary); the previous analysis becomes Step 0.5.
- `/gse:reqs` — new Step 0 "Open Questions Gate"; previous "Conversational Elicitation" renumbered to Step 0.5. Mode-Specific Ceremony table updated accordingly.
- `/gse:assess`, `/gse:design` — new Step 0 "Open Questions Gate" inserted before their first existing step.

### Fixed
- Greenfield experts (training session learner05) previously had to improvise ad-hoc scope-lock elicitation outside the lifecycle (DEC-003 methodology deviation, 9-question ad-hoc elicitation). With the Open Questions mechanism + activity-entry scan, scope-shaping questions now flow from Intent Capture → `/gse:plan` Step 0 automatically, respecting the methodology.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (activities go/collect + orchestrator + new template)

### Added
- **Intent Capture for greenfield projects** (AMÉL-07 from training feedback) — When `/gse:go` detects a greenfield project (no source files after standard exclusions) AND no existing intent artefact, it now enters Intent Capture BEFORE the complexity assessment. Produces a formal `INT-001` artefact at the canonical path `docs/intent.md` with four mandatory sections (Description verbatim, Reformulated understanding, Users, Boundaries) + optional Open questions tagged with their natural resolution home. Applies to **all expertise levels** — tone and cadence adapted via P9. Seeded backlog items carry `traces.derives_from: [INT-001]` preserving intent-to-backlog provenance.
- New artefact type `intent` with prefix `INT-` added to spec P6 (Traceability) table.
- New template file `gse-one/src/templates/intent.md` with standardized structure.
- New `/gse:collect` Step 0 "Verify Intent Exists" — preflight check on greenfield that redirects to Intent Capture if no intent artefact is present.
- New *Intent Capture for Greenfield Projects* section in the orchestrator.
- New *Intent Capture — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` detailing trigger detection, artefact structure, elicitation loop, integration with downstream activities (REQS, ASSESS, PLAN), and failure modes.

### Changed
- Spec §3 decision tree: previous trigger *"`it_expertise: beginner` + `current_sprint: 0`"* replaced by *"greenfield project + no intent artefact"*. The trigger is now project state, not user profile. Experts greenfield no longer bypass intent capture silently.
- Spec §3 Step 5 "Intent-first mode" renamed to "Intent Capture" and rewritten to reflect the new trigger and formal artefact output.
- `/gse:go` Step 7 "Intent-First Mode" renamed to "Intent Capture", trigger broadened, explicit step to write `docs/intent.md` added, existing artefact detection added.
- Spec §15 glossary: "Intent-first mode" entry updated to "Intent Capture" with the new semantics; new "Intent artefact (`INT-`)" entry added.

### Fixed
- Greenfield experts (training session learner05) previously bypassed the agent's Intent-First flow and had to improvise an ad-hoc `docs/intent.md` file without a standard structure. The formal artefact + broadened trigger now serves all expertise levels.

### Migration note
Pre-v0.28 projects without an `INT-` artefact are unaffected — the trigger fires only on greenfield new projects. Existing projects with improvised `intent.md` files can adopt the new format manually by renaming their file to match the canonical template (frontmatter `id: INT-001` + four standard sections).

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (activities design/preview/produce/task + orchestrator + status.yaml schema)

### Added
- **Scope Reconciliation guardrail** (AMÉL-05 from training feedback, also closes AMÉL-17) — At the end of every creator activity that produces code (`/gse:produce`, `/gse:task`), the agent compares delivered files against the planned REQ/DEC set. Detection is deterministic via `git diff --name-status {activity_start_sha}..HEAD` cross-referenced with per-commit `Traces:` trailers. Deltas categorized as `ADDED out of scope`, `OMITTED`, or `MODIFIED beyond plan`. If non-empty, a 4-option Gate fires: *Accept as deliberate* (grouped DEC-NNN summarizing additions by theme, OMITTED items move to backlog pool), *Revert out-of-scope*, *Amend* (lightweight REQ/DEC appended without re-elicitation), *Discuss*. Skipped silently when all deltas are aligned.
- **Inform-Tier Decisions Summary** — At the end of every creator activity (`/gse:design`, `/gse:preview`, `/gse:produce`, `/gse:task`), the agent lists the Inform-tier decisions it made autonomously (P7) and offers a 3-option Gate: *Accept all as-is* (default, appended as `## Inform-tier Decisions` section in the activity's artefact), *Promote one or more to Gate* (retrospective elevation with standard Gate format), *Discuss*. Empty-list case shown explicitly as *"No inform-tier decisions made this activity — all choices were Gated."*
- New `activity_start_sha` field in `.gse/status.yaml` — HEAD SHA recorded at creator-activity start, used exclusively for Scope Reconciliation, cleared on closure.
- New *Creator-Activity Closure Invariant* section in the orchestrator combining both mechanisms.
- New *Scope Reconciliation & Inform-Tier Summary — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` with full git-diff mechanics, trace parsing, delta categorization, Gate formats, and failure modes.
- New *Scope Reconciliation — creator-activity closure check* paragraph in spec P6 (Traceability); new *Inform-Tier Decisions Summary* subsection in spec P16 (AI Integrity).

### Changed
- `/gse:produce` — added Step 2 sub-step "Record activity start SHA", new Step 4.5 (Scope Reconciliation) between test run and Finalize, new Step 5.5 (Inform-Tier Summary) between Finalize and dashboard regen, Finalize step renumbered.
- `/gse:task` — same pattern (SHA record in Step 4, Step 5.5 Scope Reconciliation, Step 6.5 Inform-Tier Summary).
- `/gse:design` — new final Step 7 Inform-Tier Summary.
- `/gse:preview` — new final Step 4 Inform-Tier Summary.

### Fixed
- Silent scope drift during PRODUCE observed in training sessions learner06 (Opus autonomous additions: `note` column, `sort_order` field, monthly total widget — none in approved plan) and learner09 (Composer2 `Uncategorized` feature added without request). The reconciliation block now surfaces these drifts at activity closure with a clear override window.

### Closed
- **AMÉL-17** (Inform-tier decisions summary) — absorbed into this release.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (activity fix + orchestrator + devil-advocate agent + status.yaml schema)

### Added
- **Root-Cause Discipline guardrail** (AMÉL-03 from training feedback) — When a defect is reported (either a review finding during `/gse:fix`, or a user-reported bug during any activity), the agent MUST follow a 4-step protocol *Read → Symptom → Hypothesis+Evidence → Patch* before modifying any file. A blind patch on unread code is forbidden; hypotheses must be evidence-tested before patching.
- **Failed-patch counter** `fix_attempts_on_current_symptom` in `.gse/status.yaml`. Increments on each patch that does not resolve the symptom. Resets on user confirmation of resolution, explicit symptom change, or new sprint promotion.
- **Devil-advocate escalation** at counter threshold (beginner=2, intermediate=3, expert=4). The agent stops patching and spawns the devil-advocate in new `focused-review` mode, which receives the symptom, chain of failed hypotheses, patches applied, and files under suspicion, and returns findings including an *external-cause suggestion* when the code itself appears sound. At least one finding must be addressed before further patching on the same symptom.
- New *Root-Cause Discipline Invariant* section in the orchestrator listing concerned vs exempt activities and transversal counter semantics.
- New *Root-Cause Discipline — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` mapping protocol steps to concrete actions, counter mechanics, devil-advocate input format, and failure modes.
- New subsection P16 *"Root-Cause Discipline before patching"* in the spec with the 4-step protocol, threshold table, and rationale.

### Changed
- `/gse:fix` Step 3 entirely rewritten as "Apply Fixes (Root-Cause Discipline)" with 5 sub-steps (3.1 Read / 3.2 Symptom / 3.3 Hypothesis+Evidence / 3.4 Patch / 3.5 Counter and Escalation). Commit trailer now REQUIRES `Root cause:` and `Evidence:` lines.
- Devil-advocate agent extended with a `focused-review` mode (on-demand invocation with symptom + hypotheses + patches + suspect files). The standard `/gse:review` mode is preserved unchanged.

### Fixed
- Unsystematic debugging ("shotgun patching") observed during training session learner02: agent applied 3 consecutive speculative patches on a theme-toggle bug before the user forced a static code review, which immediately revealed the real cause was external (CORS `file://`) — not in the patched code at all.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (activities hug/go + orchestrator), **docs** (README)

### Added
- **Git Identity Verification guardrail** (AMÉL-04 from training feedback) — `/gse:hug` Step 4 and `/gse:go` Step 2.7 now verify that a git identity (user name + email) is configured globally OR locally before attempting the foundational / auto-fix commit. If missing, the agent presents a 5-option Git Identity Gate: *Set global* (default) / *Set local* / *Quick placeholder* (sets `GSE User` / `user@local` locally, with a one-shot reminder to replace before sharing) / *I'll set it myself* / *Discuss*. Email format validation (`@` + dotted domain) on options 1 and 2. Prevents silent commit failures on fresh machines, classroom laptops, and CI containers.
- New *Git Identity Verification Invariant* section in the orchestrator listing writing vs exempt activities and the Gate shape.
- New *Git Identity Verification — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` mapping conceptual terms to concrete `git config` commands, with the email validation rule and the placeholder reminder policy.
- Enriched P12.0 *Foundational commit* rule in the spec with explicit identity precondition; new rule P12.6 formalizes the Git Identity Gate.

### Changed
- README quickstart (shared note after all 3 platform options) now clarifies that `git init` in `my-project/` creates an independent repository, distinct from the `.git/` of the gensem clone, and that GSE-One handles git identity setup automatically on first commit. Addresses the "when should git init happen?" ambiguity raised in training feedback (learner05).

### Fixed
- Silent commit failure on fresh machines when `user.name` / `user.email` are not configured (learner03 training session: first commit blocked, had to run `git config` commands manually before proceeding).

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (tool `dashboard.py`, generator hooks, opencode TS plugin, config template)

### Added
- **Automatic dashboard regeneration via editor hooks** (AMÉL-02 from training feedback) — `docs/dashboard.html` is now kept in sync with project state automatically. A cross-platform `PostToolUse` hook with **three separate matcher entries** (`Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`) fires on every editor write and invokes `dashboard.py --if-stale`, which regenerates only if sprint state is newer than the existing dashboard, with a **configurable debounce window** (default: 5 seconds). The three-matcher approach ensures portability across Claude Code, Cursor, and opencode (including local-model setups) without relying on regex matcher support. Covers the 17 previously-uncovered activities.
- New `--if-stale` flag on `dashboard.py` with self-arbitrating mtime comparison.
- New `dashboard.regen_debounce_seconds` field in the `config.yaml` template (default: 5).
- **Failure visibility** — on internal exception, `dashboard.py` writes `.gse/.dashboard-error.yaml`. On next successful regeneration, a prominent red warning banner is injected at the top of the dashboard HTML, then the marker is cleared. A hook-wrapper double-defense covers the case where `dashboard.py` cannot start at all (subprocess non-zero exit writes a minimal marker).
- Opencode TS plugin extended to dispatch on `edit`/`write`/`multiedit` with the same marker-writing behavior on subprocess failure.

### Changed
- The 6 existing explicit regeneration calls in `hug`, `go`, `produce`, `review`, `deliver`, `compound` are preserved as belt-and-suspenders — the new hook is complementary, not substitutive.

### Fixed
- Dashboard staleness: previously 17 of 23 activities left the dashboard untouched, causing learners to see outdated sprint/phase/activity info between checkpoints (observed during training sessions learner02 and learner05).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-19

Layers impacted: **spec**, **design**, **implementation** (activities task/produce/fix/review + orchestrator)

### Added
- **Sprint Freeze guardrail** (AMÉL-01 from training feedback) — Once a sprint has been delivered, its plan transitions to *completed* and the sprint is frozen. Four writing activities (`/gse:task`, `/gse:produce`, `/gse:fix`, `/gse:review`) now present a Hard Sprint Freeze Gate when invoked on a frozen sprint, with default option to open the successor sprint via the mode-appropriate opening sequence. Three Gate options only: *Start next sprint now* / *Cancel* / *Discuss* — no "amend closed sprint" escape hatch. Complementary work is captured by opening a new sprint (e.g. titled *"Sprint N+1 — Complementary tasks"*).
- New *Sprint Freeze Invariant* section in the orchestrator (`src/agents/gse-orchestrator.md`) listing writing activities, exempt activities, Gate semantics, and promotion mechanics.
- New *Sprint Freeze — Design Mechanics* subsection in `gse-one-implementation-design.md` bridging spec-level concepts (*sprint plan status*, *the number of the sprint in progress*) to concrete implementation artefacts (`.gse/plan.yaml.status`, `.gse/status.yaml → current_sprint`).

### Changed
- `/gse:task` description in spec (§3.1) no longer fuit les noms de champs YAML (`artefact_type`, `sprint`) — vocabulaire conceptuel only, avec renvoi explicite au garde-fou Sprint Freeze.
- Decision tree in spec (§12) clarifies when the *number of the sprint in progress* advances: only `/gse:plan --strategic` increments it. The window between `/gse:integrate` and the next `/gse:plan --strategic` is naturally frozen and now handled by the Sprint Freeze Gate.

### Fixed
- Sprint closure is no longer silently violated by ad-hoc tasks / production / fix / review activities invoked post-delivery (bug observed during training session learner02).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (docs, major refactor)

### Changed
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` §6.1 restructured into **three unified tables** sorted descending by SWE-bench Verified (April 2026):
  - §6.1.1 **Recommended local coding models** — merges the previous commodity (8–32 GB) and high-RAM (≥ 128 GB) tiers into a single 15-row table; adds `qwen3.6:35b-a3b` (73.4 % SWE-V) as the new top local pick, plus `qwen3.5:27b` (72.4 %), `qwen3.5:122b-a10b` (72.0 %), `qwen3.5:35b-a3b` (69.2 %), `qwen3:235b-a22b`.
  - §6.1.2 **Frontier open-weight models (via a cloud endpoint)** — 12 rows topped by MiniMax M2.5 (80.2 %), MiMo-V2-Pro (78.0 %), GLM-5 (77.8 %); adds the full MiMo V2 family (Pro / Omni / Flash), Qwen3.5-397B-A17B, Step-3.5-Flash.
  - §6.1.3 **Best SWE/coding models on OpenRouter** — 15 rows topped by Claude Opus 4.7 (87.6 %), Opus 4.6 (80.8 %), Gemini 3.1 Pro (80.6 %); new additions: Gemini 3.1/3 Pro Preview, GPT-5.2, Qwen3.6 Plus, Grok 4.20 (2 M context, multi-agent), Z.AI GLM-5 (replaces GLM-4.5), Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash.
- All three tables share a **9-column schema** (Model, Org, Params, Min VRAM/RAM, SWE-bench V., Context, GSE-One fit, Features, Best for/Notes). New **Features** column codes tool-calling, vision, thinking mode, agentic capabilities, websearch, FIM, long-ctx, multi-agent.

### Added
- §6.1 intro — legend for the Features column and explanation of the three-source sourcing strategy (local / open-weight cloud / OpenRouter).
- §8 references — added SWE-bench.com, LLM-Stats, BenchLM leaderboards.

## [0.21.7] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (docs)

### Added
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` §6.1.4 — Claude model family rows on OpenRouter: **Claude Opus 4.7** (★★★★★, 87.6 % SWE-Verified — new table leader), **Claude Sonnet 4.6** (★★★★★, 79.6 %) and **Claude Haiku 4.5** (★★★★☆, > 73 %). Provider snippet and GSE-One recommendations updated to reference them per activity.

### Fixed
- Corrected OpenRouter model ID for Claude Sonnet: `anthropic/claude-4.6-sonnet` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` (OpenRouter uses the `<line>-<version>` order).

## [0.21.6] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (docs)

### Added
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` §6.1.3 and §6.1.4 — new "GSE-One fit" column (1–5 stars) on both model tables (frontier open-weight via cloud, OpenRouter). Ratings weight tool-calling reliability, context ≥ 128 k, SWE-bench Verified, and multi-step reasoning — the four capabilities GSE-One relies on for its full 23-activity lifecycle. Legend explains the scale under the OpenRouter table.

### Changed
- Clarified in the OpenRouter table that ★★☆☆☆ models (e.g. Codestral 25.08) are niche-only for inline completion, not recommended as primary for GSE-One agentic flow.

## [0.21.5] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (docs)

### Added
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` §6.1.4 — "Via OpenRouter (unified gateway)" with a ready-to-paste `opencode.json` provider snippet and a table of the top coding/SWE models on OpenRouter as of April 2026: MiniMax M2.5, Claude 4.6 Sonnet, Zhipu GLM-4.5, DeepSeek V3.2, Mistral Devstral (Medium/2512/Small), Qwen3-Coder, Kimi K2.5, **Codestral 25.08**, Mistral Large 3. Each row gives exact model ID, license, SWE-bench Verified score, context, input/output price per 1 M tokens, and best-fit GSE-One activity. Explicit note that Codestral is a fill-in-the-middle specialist, not a full agentic model.
- §8 references expanded with OpenRouter programming collection, Mistral provider page, OpenRouter rankings (April 2026), Codestral benchmarks review, and Codestral local deployment guide.

## [0.21.4] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (docs)

### Added
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` §6.1.3 — "Frontier open-weight models (via a cloud endpoint)" table: MiniMax M2.5 (80.2 % SWE-bench V.), GLM-5 (77.8), Kimi K2.5 (76.8), Step-3.5-Flash (74.4), GLM-4.7 (73.8), DeepSeek V3.2 (~73), Qwen3-Coder-480B (SWE-Pro 38.7), DeepSeek R1 (49.2). Each row gives license, MoE total/active, context, and opencode-specific usage note. Includes GSE-One-oriented recommendations (solo/cost-sensitive, privacy-critical, best-quality).
- §8 references expanded with Scale SWE-Bench Pro leaderboard, SWE-bench.com, BenchLM, Vellum, MorphLLM.

## [0.21.3] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (docs)

### Added
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` §6.1.2 — "High-RAM workstations (≥ 128 GB)" tier with Qwen 2.5 Coder 72B (Q8), Llama 3.3 70B (Q8), DeepSeek R1 70B distill, Mistral Large 123B (Q5), Llama 4 Scout (Q6), Qwen3 235B-A22B (Q4). Includes RAM-footprint estimates, MLX performance note for Apple Silicon, expected tok/s, and a "still out of reach at 128 GB" list (Qwen3-Coder 480B, DeepSeek V3/R1 full).
- §6.1 renamed §6.1.1 to "Commodity hardware (8–32 GB)" for clarity against the new tier.
- Extra references added to §8 (Apple Silicon guide, DeepSeek models guide, DeepSeek GPU requirements, opencode Tools doc).

## [0.21.2] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (docs, trivial)

### Added
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` §6.4 — clarification that opencode's built-in `websearch` tool requires `OPENCODE_ENABLE_EXA=1` + an Exa API key when running on a local provider (Ollama, LM Studio). `webfetch` stays available in all cases.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (docs)

### Changed
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` — slimmed to opencode-specific content only (prerequisites, install/upgrade/uninstall, troubleshooting). Duplicated GSE-One background, command reference, and lifecycle moved to references to `README.md` and `gse-one-spec.md`.

### Added
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` §6 — "Run opencode with a local model (Ollama / LM Studio)" with curated list of 2026-current local coding models (Qwen3-Coder-Next, Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B, Llama 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, Devstral Small 2), exact `opencode.json` provider snippets for Ollama and LM Studio, and agentic-flow tuning notes (context ≥ 64k, tool-calling on, temperature low). Model choices backed by April 2026 benchmarks — see references list in the doc.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **production** (major — new platform), **spec**, **design**

### Added
- **opencode platform support.** GSE-One now deploys natively on [opencode](https://opencode.ai) alongside Claude Code and Cursor. Installer gains `--platform opencode` and `--platform all` (all three platforms at once). Two install modes supported: `plugin` (global, `~/.config/opencode/`) and `no-plugin` (project, `.opencode/`).
- `gse-one/plugin/opencode/` — new generated subtree assembled from existing sources. Contains: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (with injected `name:` frontmatter required by opencode's loader), `commands/gse-<name>.md` (identical to Cursor), `agents/<name>.md` (8 specialized, `mode: subagent`, opencode `tools` object format), `plugins/gse-guardrails.ts` (native TS plugin reproducing the 3 guardrails from `hooks.claude.json`), `AGENTS.md` (orchestrator body wrapped in `<!-- GSE-ONE START/END -->` markers for surgical merge), `opencode.json` (default permissions + version marker).
- `install.py` — 4 new install/uninstall functions (`install_opencode_plugin`, `install_opencode_no_plugin`, and their uninstall counterparts), plus `_merge_agents_md`, `_strip_agents_md_block`, `_merge_opencode_json`, `_strip_opencode_json_marker`, `_deep_merge`, `_detect_opencode`. Interactive menu updated for opencode and "all three platforms".
- `gse_generate.py` — `build_opencode()` phase with 6 builders. SKILL.md files now receive `name:` injection globally (harmless for Claude, required by opencode).
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` — user-facing quickstart for opencode installation and first-project setup.
- README files updated to list opencode as a supported platform.

### Changed
- `gse_generate.py` — generator docstring and `--verify` checks extended to cover the opencode subtree (skills, commands, agents, AGENTS.md body parity with `.mdc`, guardrails pattern presence).
- `install.py` — `--platform` choices extended to `opencode`, `all`; environment detection displays opencode status; duplicate detection warns on `.claude/skills` + `.opencode/` coexistence (opencode loads both).
- `CLAUDE.md` — "Files to keep in sync" updated with the opencode subtree.

## [0.20.8] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (trivial)

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — new "Memory policy — in-repo only" section: any convention, rule, or preference Claude must remember across sessions for this project MUST live in a versioned file in the repo, never in Claude's per-machine auto-memory under `$HOME`. Rationale: the user works on this project from multiple machines via Dropbox; only the repo travels.

## [0.20.7] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (trivial)

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` — Build pipeline now explicitly requires a `CHANGELOG.md` update between the VERSION bump and the generator run (step 2 of 6). Rationale: the v0.20.5 release shipped without a changelog entry; promoting the convention to a hard rule prevents recurrence.

## [0.20.6] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **production** (trivial)

### Changed
- CHANGELOG catch-up release — documents the v0.20.5 fix that shipped without a changelog entry

## [0.20.5] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **production** (minor)

### Fixed
- Claude Code no-plugin install: skills are now copied as `gse-<name>/` so commands appear as `/gse-<name>` in the TUI (e.g. `/gse-go`, `/gse-plan`) instead of the bare `/<name>` that project-level skills would otherwise receive — closest no-plugin UX to the `/gse:<name>` namespace produced by plugin mode

### Changed
- `install.py` — no-plugin mode now requires explicit confirmation of the naming trade-off before writing anything to disk
- `install.py` — legacy unprefixed skill directories from a prior install (≤ v0.20.4) are cleaned up automatically before the new prefixed layout is written
- `install.py` — `uninstall_claude_no_plugin` removes both prefixed (current) and unprefixed (legacy) layouts, making reinstall idempotent across versions

### Added
- Duplicate detection for Claude Code plugin mode now also checks `~/.claude/skills/` (home-level) in addition to the current project, catching conflicts for user-scope installs across all projects
- Duplicate detection for Claude Code no-plugin mode now probes `claude plugin list` to detect a registered `gse` plugin (previously skipped)
- New helpers `_detect_claude_plugin_installed()` and `_has_gse_skills_in_dir()` in `install.py`

## [0.20.4] - 2026-04-17

Layers impacted: **spec** (moderate), **design** (moderate), **source** (minor)

### Changed
- Lightweight `workflow.expected` aligned to `[plan, reqs, produce, deliver]` across all sources (was `[plan, produce, deliver]` in `plan.md` and design §10.1)
- FIX activity documented as conditional: `[FIX]` notation in LC02 sequence, glossary, ASCII diagram (spec); post-REVIEW mutation protocol added to design §10.1 and §5.14 decision table
- Complexity assessment: 7 structural signals (was 8) — source file count reclassified as trivialiy pre-filter for Micro detection, not a complexity signal (spec glossary, design §5.5, `go.md`, orchestrator)
- File inventory updated: 23 skills (was 22), 19 templates (was 15), 57 total files (was 52) in design §3.1, §11, §12
- Test review tier `[IMPL]` explicitly named in design §5.11
- Document versioning references removed from spec and design (version history consolidated in this file)
- Design §11.1 Evolution table removed (version history belongs in CHANGELOG.md)
- Design §5 renamed from "New Skill Designs (v0.6)" to "Skill Designs"
- Design §2, §9: removed "Unchanged from v0.2" cross-references to old document versions

### Fixed
- `plan_status` field: confirmed absent from both documents (removed in v0.20.1, no residual references)

## [0.17.1] - 2026-04-14

Layers impacted: **spec** (moderate), **design** (minor), **production** (minor)

### Added
- P12 rule 0: mandatory foundational commit on `main` after `git init` in HUG Step 4 — without it, all branching operations fail
- `/gse:go` Step 2.7: git baseline verification as safety net before branching (auto-fixes missing foundational commit)
- `/gse:plan` and `/gse:produce`: precondition check verifying `main` has at least one commit before creating branches
- Section 14.0.1: activity ceremony table by expertise level — defines minimum ceremony for each activity at beginner/intermediate/advanced levels
- Non-fusion rule in orchestrator Process Discipline and spec — activities MUST be executed as separate steps, adaptation is in communication not lifecycle structure
- Section 12.4.1: required fields specification for `config.yaml` and `status.yaml` — normative schema for dashboard and tool consumers
- Dashboard smoke test: validation warnings on stderr when required fields are missing or contain placeholder values

### Changed
- P16 passive acceptance counter: clarified increment rules (Gate decisions, single-word artefact confirmations) and reset rules (Discuss, why, modifications, rejections)
- `status.yaml` template: simplified P16 fields to `consecutive_acceptances` + `pushback_dismissed`, removed redundant boolean signals
- `dashboard.py`: fixed nested key lookup (`project.name`, `project.domain`, `lifecycle.mode`) for compatibility with spec-compliant config files

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-14

Layers impacted: **spec** (major), **design** (minor), **production** (moderate)

### Added
- Conversational elicitation (Step 0) in `/gse:reqs` — free-form user dialogue before formalization captures functional needs and implicit quality expectations
- ISO 25010-inspired quality assurance checklist (Step 7) in `/gse:reqs` — verifies NFR completeness across 7 dimensions (Performance, Security, Reliability, Usability, Maintainability, Accessibility, Compatibility) with gap classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Quality coverage matrix persisted in `reqs.md` template
- Quality-driven test derivation in `/gse:tests` — gaps from the quality checklist generate corresponding TST- artefacts with `quality_gap` trace
- Quality checklist completion check in `/gse:review` (Step 2c, requirements-analyst perspective)
- `--elicit` option in `/gse:reqs` — run only the conversational elicitation phase
- `elicitation_summary` field in requirements template frontmatter
