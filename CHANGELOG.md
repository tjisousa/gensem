# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **production** (major — new platform), **spec**, **design**

### Added
- **opencode platform support.** GSE-One now deploys natively on [opencode](https://opencode.ai) alongside Claude Code and Cursor. Installer gains `--platform opencode` and `--platform all` (all three platforms at once). Two install modes supported: `plugin` (global, `~/.config/opencode/`) and `no-plugin` (project, `.opencode/`).
- `gse-one/plugin/opencode/` — new generated subtree assembled from existing sources. Contains: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (with injected `name:` frontmatter required by opencode's loader), `commands/gse-<name>.md` (identical to Cursor), `agents/<name>.md` (8 specialized, `mode: subagent`, opencode `tools` object format), `plugins/gse-guardrails.ts` (native TS plugin reproducing the 3 guardrails from `hooks.claude.json`), `AGENTS.md` (orchestrator body wrapped in `<!-- GSE-ONE START/END -->` markers for surgical merge), `opencode.json` (default permissions + version marker).
- `install.py` — 4 new install/uninstall functions (`install_opencode_plugin`, `install_opencode_no_plugin`, and their uninstall counterparts), plus `_merge_agents_md`, `_strip_agents_md_block`, `_merge_opencode_json`, `_strip_opencode_json_marker`, `_deep_merge`, `_detect_opencode`. Interactive menu updated for opencode and "all three platforms".
- `gse_generate.py` — `build_opencode()` phase with 6 builders. SKILL.md files now receive `name:` injection globally (harmless for Claude, required by opencode).
- `INSTALL-OPENCODE.md` — user-facing quickstart for opencode installation and first-project setup.
- README files updated to list opencode as a supported platform.

### Changed
- `gse_generate.py` — generator docstring and `--verify` checks extended to cover the opencode subtree (skills, commands, agents, AGENTS.md body parity with `.mdc`, guardrails pattern presence).
- `install.py` — `--platform` choices extended to `opencode`, `all`; environment detection displays opencode status; duplicate detection warns on `.claude/skills` + `.opencode/` coexistence (opencode loads both).
- `CLAUDE.md` — "Files to keep in sync" updated with the opencode subtree.

## [0.20.8] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (trivial)

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — new "Memory policy — in-repo only" section: any convention, rule, or preference Claude must remember across sessions for this project MUST live in a versioned file in the repo, never in Claude's per-machine auto-memory under `$HOME`. Rationale: the user works on this project from multiple machines via Dropbox; only the repo travels.

## [0.20.7] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **spec** (trivial)

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` — Build pipeline now explicitly requires a `CHANGELOG.md` update between the VERSION bump and the generator run (step 2 of 6). Rationale: the v0.20.5 release shipped without a changelog entry; promoting the convention to a hard rule prevents recurrence.

## [0.20.6] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **production** (trivial)

### Changed
- CHANGELOG catch-up release — documents the v0.20.5 fix that shipped without a changelog entry

## [0.20.5] - 2026-04-18

Layers impacted: **production** (minor)

### Fixed
- Claude Code no-plugin install: skills are now copied as `gse-<name>/` so commands appear as `/gse-<name>` in the TUI (e.g. `/gse-go`, `/gse-plan`) instead of the bare `/<name>` that project-level skills would otherwise receive — closest no-plugin UX to the `/gse:<name>` namespace produced by plugin mode

### Changed
- `install.py` — no-plugin mode now requires explicit confirmation of the naming trade-off before writing anything to disk
- `install.py` — legacy unprefixed skill directories from a prior install (≤ v0.20.4) are cleaned up automatically before the new prefixed layout is written
- `install.py` — `uninstall_claude_no_plugin` removes both prefixed (current) and unprefixed (legacy) layouts, making reinstall idempotent across versions

### Added
- Duplicate detection for Claude Code plugin mode now also checks `~/.claude/skills/` (home-level) in addition to the current project, catching conflicts for user-scope installs across all projects
- Duplicate detection for Claude Code no-plugin mode now probes `claude plugin list` to detect a registered `gse` plugin (previously skipped)
- New helpers `_detect_claude_plugin_installed()` and `_has_gse_skills_in_dir()` in `install.py`

## [0.20.4] - 2026-04-17

Layers impacted: **spec** (moderate), **design** (moderate), **source** (minor)

### Changed
- Lightweight `workflow.expected` aligned to `[plan, reqs, produce, deliver]` across all sources (was `[plan, produce, deliver]` in `plan.md` and design §10.1)
- FIX activity documented as conditional: `[FIX]` notation in LC02 sequence, glossary, ASCII diagram (spec); post-REVIEW mutation protocol added to design §10.1 and §5.14 decision table
- Complexity assessment: 7 structural signals (was 8) — source file count reclassified as trivialiy pre-filter for Micro detection, not a complexity signal (spec glossary, design §5.5, `go.md`, orchestrator)
- File inventory updated: 23 skills (was 22), 19 templates (was 15), 57 total files (was 52) in design §3.1, §11, §12
- Test review tier `[IMPL]` explicitly named in design §5.11
- Document versioning references removed from spec and design (version history consolidated in this file)
- Design §11.1 Evolution table removed (version history belongs in CHANGELOG.md)
- Design §5 renamed from "New Skill Designs (v0.6)" to "Skill Designs"
- Design §2, §9: removed "Unchanged from v0.2" cross-references to old document versions

### Fixed
- `plan_status` field: confirmed absent from both documents (removed in v0.20.1, no residual references)

## [0.17.1] - 2026-04-14

Layers impacted: **spec** (moderate), **design** (minor), **production** (minor)

### Added
- P12 rule 0: mandatory foundational commit on `main` after `git init` in HUG Step 4 — without it, all branching operations fail
- `/gse:go` Step 2.7: git baseline verification as safety net before branching (auto-fixes missing foundational commit)
- `/gse:plan` and `/gse:produce`: precondition check verifying `main` has at least one commit before creating branches
- Section 14.0.1: activity ceremony table by expertise level — defines minimum ceremony for each activity at beginner/intermediate/advanced levels
- Non-fusion rule in orchestrator Process Discipline and spec — activities MUST be executed as separate steps, adaptation is in communication not lifecycle structure
- Section 12.4.1: required fields specification for `config.yaml` and `status.yaml` — normative schema for dashboard and tool consumers
- Dashboard smoke test: validation warnings on stderr when required fields are missing or contain placeholder values

### Changed
- P16 passive acceptance counter: clarified increment rules (Gate decisions, single-word artefact confirmations) and reset rules (Discuss, why, modifications, rejections)
- `status.yaml` template: simplified P16 fields to `consecutive_acceptances` + `pushback_dismissed`, removed redundant boolean signals
- `dashboard.py`: fixed nested key lookup (`project.name`, `project.domain`, `lifecycle.mode`) for compatibility with spec-compliant config files

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-14

Layers impacted: **spec** (major), **design** (minor), **production** (moderate)

### Added
- Conversational elicitation (Step 0) in `/gse:reqs` — free-form user dialogue before formalization captures functional needs and implicit quality expectations
- ISO 25010-inspired quality assurance checklist (Step 7) in `/gse:reqs` — verifies NFR completeness across 7 dimensions (Performance, Security, Reliability, Usability, Maintainability, Accessibility, Compatibility) with gap classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Quality coverage matrix persisted in `reqs.md` template
- Quality-driven test derivation in `/gse:tests` — gaps from the quality checklist generate corresponding TST- artefacts with `quality_gap` trace
- Quality checklist completion check in `/gse:review` (Step 2c, requirements-analyst perspective)
- `--elicit` option in `/gse:reqs` — run only the conversational elicitation phase
- `elicitation_summary` field in requirements template frontmatter
- Section 0 "Getting Started" in spec — prerequisites and 20-minute quickstart for first-time learners
- "Essential Concepts" card (20 terms) at the top of the glossary (Section 15)
- 12 missing glossary terms: spike, acceptance criteria, lifecycle phases, intent-first mode, supervised mode, micro mode, stale sprint, design debt, regression test, quality gap, dependency audit, quality coverage matrix
- Commands-by-phase table (Section 3.10) mapping all 23 commands to lifecycle phases
- Spike documentation in `/gse:task` description (Section 3.1) — `--spike` flag with full rules
- Micro mode row in orchestrator decision tree (Section 14.3, Step 2) — was missing from spec

### Changed
- `/gse:reqs` workflow: 7 steps → 9 steps (added Step 0 elicitation, Step 7 quality checklist, renumbered Step 7 Persist → Step 8)
- Orchestrator guardrail "No PRODUCE without REQS" now also requires quality checklist completion
- Beginner output filter: 5 new entries (elicitation, quality checklist, quality gap, quality coverage matrix, updated `/gse:reqs` description)
- Lightweight mode row in decision tree now explicitly names the 3 health dimensions (test_pass_rate, review_findings, git_hygiene)
- Version notes and changelogs externalized from spec and design doc to this file (single source of truth)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-13

- Beginner artefact approval via plain-language summaries (not raw technical files)
- Git branch check in PRODUCE (reminder, not blocker)
- Mandatory test campaign reports in `test-reports/` after every PRODUCE test run
- Requirements coverage analysis step in REQS (proactive gap detection across 9 dimensions)
- Dashboard: cumulative view (all sprints + archive), YAML parser handles nested keys
- HUG dimension #13: user name
- Compound auto-captures process deviations from review findings
- Tool registry `~/.gse-one` written by `install.py`

### Changed
- Branch naming: sprint integration branch renamed to `gse/sprint-NN/integration` (avoids git path conflict)
- Manual testing procedure in PRODUCE (adapted to project type and user level)
- Health scores written by review and deliver activities

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-13

Layers impacted: **spec** (major), **design** (moderate), **production** (major)

### Added
- §1.2 Agile Foundations (principles, adaptations, originals)
- Test-driven requirements: acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then) mandatory in REQS, validation test derivation in TESTS
- Lifecycle guardrails (Hard): no PRODUCE without REQS, no PRODUCE without test strategy
- Spike mode (`artefact_type: spike`): complexity-boxed (max 3 pts), non-deliverable, bypasses REQS/TESTS guardrails
- Micro mode (< 3 files): PRODUCE → DELIVER, direct commit, 1 state file
- Supervised mode: `decision_involvement: supervised` escalates all PRODUCE choices to Gate
- Beginner output filter (28-entry translation table in orchestrator)
- Interactive question support (AskUserQuestion / Cursor clarifying questions)

### Added
- `/gse:deploy` skill (23rd command): deploy current project to Hetzner server via Coolify
- Flexible starting points: from zero infrastructure (solo) to pre-configured shared server (training mode)
- 6-phase workflow: setup → provision → secure → install Coolify → configure DNS → deploy application
- Situation detection (Step 0): reads `.env` variables to skip completed phases automatically
- Training mode: `DEPLOY_USER` variable for per-learner subdomains on shared servers
- Templates: `deploy.json` (state schema), `Dockerfile` (Python/Streamlit), `deploy-env.example` (solo), `deploy-env-training.example` (training)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-12

Layers impacted: **spec** (major), **production** (moderate), **design** (minor)

### Added
- Three-level language management: `chat` (agent communication), `artifacts` (produced files, default: en), `overrides` (per-artefact-type). Configured at HUG, changeable at any time.
- Output formatting rules in P9: bold/italic/lists/code blocks conventions for cross-platform readability. Emoji dimension (on/off) added to HUG profile.
- Recovery check in `/gse:go` (Step 2): detects uncommitted changes from sessions that ended without `/gse:pause`, proposes recovery commit.
- Intent-first mode in `/gse:go` (Step 6): conversational intent elicitation for `beginner` users with new projects, plain language activity descriptions.
- Progressive expertise by domain: `expertise_domains` field in profile (empty at start, populated by agent observation). Per-domain calibration of communication depth and decision tiers.

### Changed
- HUG profile: `mother_tongue` replaced by `language: {chat, artifacts, overrides}`. Added `emoji` field. Profile now has 12 dimensions.
- P9 (Adaptive Communication): 6 rules → 9 rules (added domain-specific expertise, ask-don't-assume refinement, no condescension, output formatting).
- `/gse:go` workflow: 5 steps → 8 steps (added recovery check, intent-first mode, renumbered).
