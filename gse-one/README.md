GSE-One is an AI engineering companion that brings structured software development lifecycle (SDLC) management to coding agents. It works as a plugin for **Claude Code** and **Cursor**, guiding projects through requirements, design, testing, production, review, and knowledge transfer — with adaptive risk analysis and methodology guardrails.

Mono-plugin architecture — cross-platform parity. See [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## What is GSE-One?

GSE-One is designed for users of **any expertise level** — from beginners building their first project to experienced engineers managing complex applications. The agent adapts its language, decisions, and level of autonomy to your profile. 23 commands covering planning, requirements, design, production, quality, delivery, deployment, and capitalization.

**v0.14.0 highlights:**
- **Interactive QCM** — clickable options (AskUserQuestion / Cursor clarifying questions) instead of numbered text lists
- **Language-first onboarding** — multilingual language question before anything else, with system locale detection
- **Test-driven requirements** — every requirement includes testable acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- **Lifecycle guardrails** — no coding without requirements and test strategy (REQS → DESIGN → PREVIEW → TESTS → PRODUCE)
- **Beginner output filter** — all jargon translated to plain language for non-IT users
- **Three project modes** — Micro (< 3 files), Lightweight (3-4), Full (≥ 5)
- **Spike mode** — complexity-boxed experiments that bypass REQS/TESTS guardrails
- **Cross-sprint regression scan** — full test suite comparison during REVIEW
- **Dependency vulnerability check** — audit at every session start
- **Sprint archival** — automatic backlog compaction and sprint directory archival during COMPOUND
- **Monorepo sub-domains** — per-directory test pyramid calibration
- **Resilience** — YAML validation, context overflow prevention, graceful degradation

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin (see Installation below)

### 2. Type `/gse:go`

The agent detects your project state and proposes the next step:
- **New project?** The agent runs an onboarding interview (`/gse:hug`) to understand your expertise and goals
- **Existing project without GSE-One?** The agent proposes to adopt it non-destructively (scan, set baseline, initialize)
- **Already set up?** The agent picks up where you left off — whether that's planning, producing, reviewing, or delivering

### 3. Follow the agent's guidance

GSE-One orchestrates the full lifecycle: `COLLECT > ASSESS > PLAN > REQS > DESIGN > PREVIEW > TESTS > PRODUCE > REVIEW > FIX > DELIVER > COMPOUND`. You don't need to memorize the commands — the agent proposes the next activity at each step.

## Installation

### Quick Start (recommended)

Clone the repository and run the interactive installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolasguelfi/gensem.git
cd gensem
python3 install.py
```

The installer detects your OS (macOS, Linux, Windows), available platforms (Claude Code, Cursor), and guides you through the installation interactively. It supports plugin mode (with scope selection) and non-plugin mode for both platforms.

For non-interactive installation, use CLI flags:

```bash
# Claude Code — plugin, project scope (recommended)
python3 install.py --platform claude --mode plugin --scope project

# Cursor — plugin, global
python3 install.py --platform cursor --mode plugin

# Both platforms at once
python3 install.py --platform both --mode plugin --scope user

# Uninstall
python3 install.py --uninstall --platform claude --mode plugin
```

Run `python3 install.py --help` for all options.

### Verify

Type `/gse:go` in Claude Code or Cursor. The agent should respond and detect your project state.

### Marketplace (when available)

Not yet operational. After approval:
```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin install gse-one

# Cursor — search "gse-one" in /add-plugin
```
