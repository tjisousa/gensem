# GSE-One — Generic Software Engineering One

Mono-plugin architecture — cross-platform parity. See [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

> AI engineering companion for structured SDLC management. 22 commands, adaptive risk analysis, unified backlog, knowledge transfer, worktree isolation.

## What is GSE-One?

GSE-One is an AI engineering companion that guides users through the full software development lifecycle. It is implemented as a single plugin deployable on both Claude Code and Cursor, providing 22 commands covering planning, requirements, design, production, quality, delivery, and capitalization.

GSE-One is designed for users of **any expertise level** — from beginners building their first project to experienced engineers managing complex applications. The agent adapts its language, decisions, and level of autonomy to your profile.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin (see Installation below)

### 2. Type `/gse:go`

The agent detects your project state and proposes the next step:
- **New project?** The agent runs an onboarding interview (`/gse:hug`) to understand your expertise and goals
- **Existing project without GSE-One?** The agent proposes to adopt it non-destructively (scan, set baseline, initialize)
- **Already set up?** The agent picks up where you left off — whether that's planning, producing, reviewing, or delivering

### 3. Follow the agent's guidance

GSE-One orchestrates the full lifecycle: `COLLECT > ASSESS > PLAN > PRODUCE > REVIEW > FIX > DELIVER > COMPOUND`. You don't need to memorize the commands — the agent proposes the next activity at each step.

## Installation

### Claude Code

#### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolasguelfi/gensem.git ~/gensem
```

#### Step 2 — Install the plugin

GSE-One adds 22 `/gse:*` commands. If you use multiple plugins, you may not want all of them loaded at all times. Choose the scope that fits your workflow:

| Scope | When GSE-One is active | Best for |
|-------|----------------------|----------|
| **Project** | Only inside a specific project directory | Most users — keeps your `/` menu clean |
| **Project (personal)** | Same, but not committed to git | Solo developers |
| **Global** | Every session, every directory | Users who want GSE-One always available |
| **One-time** | Current terminal session only | Quick testing |

**Project scope (recommended)** — run from your project root:
```bash
claude plugin install ~/gensem/gse-one/plugin --scope project
```
Creates `.claude/settings.json` in the project (committable, shared with the team). The plugin is only active when Claude Code is launched inside this directory. Other projects remain unaffected.

**Project scope (personal)** — same, but gitignored:
```bash
claude plugin install ~/gensem/gse-one/plugin --scope local
```
Writes to `.claude/settings.local.json` (not committed to git).

**Global scope** — available everywhere:
```bash
claude plugin install ~/gensem/gse-one/plugin --scope user
```
Adds the plugin to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Active in every session regardless of working directory.

**One-time session** — testing only:
```bash
claude --plugin-dir ~/gensem/gse-one/plugin/
```
Loads the plugin for the current session. Nothing is persisted.

#### Step 3 — Verify

Type `/gse:go`. The agent should respond and detect your project state.

#### Marketplace (when available)

Not yet operational. After approval by Anthropic:
```bash
claude plugin install gse-one
```

---

### Cursor

#### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolasguelfi/gensem.git ~/gensem
```

#### Step 2 — Install the plugin

Like Claude Code, Cursor supports different installation scopes. Choose the one that fits your workflow:

| Scope | When GSE-One is active | Best for |
|-------|----------------------|----------|
| **Project (team)** | Only inside a specific project, shared with the team | Teams — plugin committed to git |
| **Project (personal)** | Only inside a specific project, not committed | Solo developers |
| **Global** | Every project opened in Cursor | Users who want GSE-One always available |

**Project scope — shared with team (recommended):**

Copy the plugin into your project root and commit it:
```bash
cp -r ~/gensem/gse-one/plugin/ /path/to/your-project/gse-one-plugin/
```
Then register it:
1. Open Cursor in your project
2. Type `/add-plugin` > **Local** > select `gse-one-plugin/`

The plugin is committed to git — every team member gets it automatically. Other projects remain unaffected.

**Project scope — personal (not committed):**

Same as above, but add the plugin directory to `.gitignore`:
```bash
cp -r ~/gensem/gse-one/plugin/ /path/to/your-project/gse-one-plugin/
echo "gse-one-plugin/" >> /path/to/your-project/.gitignore
```
Then register via `/add-plugin` > **Local** > select `gse-one-plugin/`.

The plugin is active in this project only and not visible to other team members.

**Global scope — available in all projects:**

Install the plugin in the Cursor user directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins
cp -r ~/gensem/gse-one/plugin/ ~/.cursor/plugins/gse-one/
```
The plugin loads automatically in every project opened in Cursor.

> **Note:** With a global install, the 22 `/gse:*` commands appear in every project. Use project scope if you prefer to keep your command menu clean.

#### Step 3 — Verify

Type `/gse:go`. The agent should respond and detect your project state.

#### Marketplace (when available)

Not yet operational. After approval by Cursor:
```
# Search "gse-one" in /add-plugin
```
