# GSE-One Fix — Fix

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Options

| Flag / Sub-command | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| (no args)          | Fix all pending review findings for the current sprint |
| `--finding RVW-NNN` | Fix a specific finding |
| `--severity HIGH`  | Fix only findings at or above the given severity |
| `--task TASK-ID`   | Fix all findings for a specific task |
| `--dry-run`        | Show fix plan without executing |
| `--help`           | Show this command's usage summary |

## Prerequisites

Before executing, read:
1. `.gse/status.yaml` — current sprint and lifecycle state
2. `.gse/config.yaml` — git strategy (worktree/branch-only/none)
3. `.gse/backlog.yaml` — tasks with review findings
4. `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/review.md` — review findings (RVW-NNN entries)
5. `.gse/profile.yaml` — user profile (apply P9 Adaptive Communication to all output)

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify Findings to Fix

1. Read `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/review.md` for all RVW-NNN findings
2. Filter by arguments (severity, task, specific finding)
3. Sort by severity (HIGH first), then by task
4. **Verify TASK status** — Each TASK with findings should have `status: fixing` (set by REVIEW). If a TASK is still `status: review` or `status: done`, set it to `fixing` now.
5. Present fix plan: list of findings to address with estimated effort
6. Wait for user confirmation (Gate)

### Step 2 — Git Setup (Per Task)

Group findings by their originating task/branch. For each group:

#### Strategy: `worktree`

1. Create fix branch from the reviewed feature branch:
   ```
   git branch gse/sprint-{NN}/fix/rvw-{ID} gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}
   ```
2. Create worktree for the fix branch:
   ```
   git worktree add .worktrees/sprint-{NN}-fix-rvw-{ID} gse/sprint-{NN}/fix/rvw-{ID}
   ```
3. All fix operations happen inside the fix worktree directory

#### Strategy: `branch-only`

1. Create fix branch from the reviewed feature branch:
   ```
   git branch gse/sprint-{NN}/fix/rvw-{ID} gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}
   git checkout gse/sprint-{NN}/fix/rvw-{ID}
   ```

#### Strategy: `none`

1. Fix in-place on the current branch

### Step 3 — Apply Fixes

For each finding (RVW-NNN):

1. Read the finding details: location (file, line), description, suggestion
2. Apply the fix according to the suggestion
3. Verify the fix resolves the finding (re-run relevant check if possible)
4. Commit with traceability:
   ```
   gse(sprint-{NN}/fix): fix RVW-{NNN} — {short description}

   Sprint: S{NN}
   Traces: RVW-{NNN}
   Finding: {finding summary}
   ```

### Step 4 — Merge Fix Back

#### Strategy: `worktree`

1. Merge fix branch into the original feature branch (fast-forward preferred):
   ```
   git checkout gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}
   git merge --ff-only gse/sprint-{NN}/fix/rvw-{ID}
   ```
   If fast-forward is not possible, use `--no-ff`.
2. Delete fix worktree:
   ```
   git worktree remove .worktrees/sprint-{NN}-fix-rvw-{ID}
   ```
3. Delete fix branch:
   ```
   git branch -d gse/sprint-{NN}/fix/rvw-{ID}
   ```

#### Strategy: `branch-only`

1. Merge fix branch into the original feature branch:
   ```
   git checkout gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}
   git merge --ff-only gse/sprint-{NN}/fix/rvw-{ID}
   git branch -d gse/sprint-{NN}/fix/rvw-{ID}
   ```

#### Strategy: `none`

1. Fixes are already applied in-place; no merge needed.

### Step 5 — Update Findings

Mark each fixed finding as resolved in `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/review.md`:
- `status: fixed`
- `fixed_by_commit: {hash}`

### Step 6 — Finalize

1. Update TASK in `backlog.yaml`:
   - `status: done` (ready to merge)
   - `review_findings_fixed: {count}`
2. Update `status.yaml`:
   - `last_activity: fix`
   - `last_activity_timestamp: {now}`
3. Report fix summary:
   - Findings fixed: {count}
   - Findings remaining: {count}
   - If all findings resolved: recommend `/gse:deliver`
   - If HIGH findings remain: recommend another `/gse:fix` pass
