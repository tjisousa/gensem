## Prerequisites

Before executing, read:
1. `.gse/status.yaml` — current sprint number
2. `.gse/config.yaml` — project configuration (language, framework, domain)
3. `.gse/profile.yaml` — user preferences
4. `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/reqs.md` — requirements to test against
5. `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/design.md` — design to test against
6. `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/test-reports/` — existing test reports (if any)
7. `.gse/status.yaml` — project health metrics (health section)

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Strategy (`--strategy`)

**Test strategy is derived from two sources:**
- **Validation tests** (acceptance, E2E) → derived from **REQS acceptance criteria** (Given/When/Then). Each acceptance criterion in `reqs.md` becomes a TST- artefact with `traces.validates: [REQ-NNN]`. These verify the app does what the user asked.
- **Verification tests** (unit, integration) → derived from **DESIGN decisions** (DES-). These verify the code is built correctly (interfaces, module boundaries, data contracts).

**Prerequisite:** REQS must exist with testable acceptance criteria. DESIGN should exist if applicable. If either is missing, report and redirect to the missing activity.

For beginners: "I'll take each feature description you confirmed and turn it into a checklist of things to verify. Some checks are from the user's point of view (does the app do what you want?) and some are technical (is the code structured correctly?)."

Define the test pyramid calibrated by project domain:

| Domain | Unit | Integration | E2E/Visual | Other |
|--------|------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Web frontend** | 20% | 20% | 40% (visual) | 20% (a11y, perf) |
| **API / backend** | 50% | 30% | 5% (smoke) | 15% (load, security) |
| **CLI tool** | 60% | 20% | 10% (smoke) | 10% (compat) |
| **Data pipeline** | 40% | 30% | 5% | 25% (data quality) |
| **Mobile app** | 25% | 20% | 35% (visual) | 20% (device compat) |
| **Library / SDK** | 70% | 20% | 0% | 10% (compat, docs) |
| **Embedded** | 50% | 25% | 0% | 25% (hardware sim) |

The strategy document defines:
- Test pyramid distribution for this project
- Coverage targets per level
- Test naming conventions (TST-NNN)
- Test data management approach
- CI/CD integration plan

Save to `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/test-strategy.md`.

### Risk-Based Prioritization (Spec 6.1)

Not all code needs equal test coverage. Prioritize testing based on risk:

| Factor | Testing Priority | Action |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Module touched by a review finding (RVW) | **High priority** | Add regression tests |
| Module with a Gate-tier decision (DEC) | **Regression test mandatory** | Ensure decision is validated |
| Module imported from external source (SRC) | **Compatibility tests mandatory** | Verify in project context |
| Security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, input) | **Comprehensive coverage** | Unit + integration + edge cases |
| Simple configuration / static content | **Minimal tests** | Smoke test only |

### Coverage Guardrail (Spec 6.4)

When code coverage drops below the configured minimum (`config.yaml → testing.coverage.minimum`, default: 60%):

**Hard guardrail triggers:**
```
GUARDRAIL [HARD]: Code coverage is {current}% (minimum: {minimum}%).
Add tests before proceeding to DELIVER.
```

The same applies to requirements coverage:
- 100% for `must` priority requirements
- 80% for `should` priority requirements

Risk coverage target: 100% of high-risk modules (security, Gate decisions, imports) must have dedicated tests.

### Adaptation to User Expertise (Spec 6.5)

The agent's testing behavior adapts to the user's level (`profile.yaml → user.it_expertise`):

| Level | Agent's Testing Behavior |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Beginner** | The agent writes all tests, executes them, and shows visual results. "8 tests pass, 2 fail — here are the screenshots." No jargon. The user sees evidence, not code. |
| **Intermediate** | The agent proposes the test strategy, writes the tests, explains what each test verifies in plain language. The user can modify tests. Technical terms introduced progressively (P14). |
| **Advanced** | The agent discusses strategy (TDD vs test-after), proposes the test pyramid, co-writes tests with the user. Coverage targets are negotiated. |
| **Expert** | Full collaboration. The agent proposes advanced techniques (property-based testing, mutation testing, contract testing). The user drives, the agent assists. |

### Step 2 — Setup (`--setup`)

Detect project language and select the appropriate test framework:

| Language | Framework | Install Command | Config File |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Python | pytest | `uv add --group dev pytest pytest-cov` | `pyproject.toml` |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | vitest | `npm install -D vitest @vitest/coverage-v8` | `vitest.config.ts` |
| JavaScript (legacy) | jest | `npm install -D jest` | `jest.config.js` |
| Go | go test | (built-in) | — |
| Rust | cargo test | (built-in) | — |
| Java | JUnit 5 | (Maven/Gradle dependency) | `build.gradle` |

**Visual testing setup** (for web/mobile projects):

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Playwright | Browser automation + screenshots | `uv add --group dev playwright` / `npm install -D @playwright/test` |
| Percy | Visual regression (cloud) | Percy SDK for chosen language |

Steps:
1. Install test framework as dev dependency
2. Create test directory structure (`tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`)
3. Create test configuration file
4. Create a sample test to verify setup works
5. Run the sample test to confirm green

### Step 3 — Write Tests

For each requirement (REQ) and design component (DES), generate tests at the appropriate level:

Each test has a unique identifier:

```yaml
---
id: TST-{NNN}
artefact_type: test
title: "Test description"
level: unit | integration | e2e | visual | performance
sprint: {NN}
status: draft
created: {date}
author: agent
traces:
  derives_from: [REQ-{NNN}]
  tests: [SRC-{NNN}]
---
```

Test file naming: `tests/{level}/test_{component}_{feature}.py` (Python example)

Test structure:
```python
# TST-007: Verify rate limiter rejects requests over threshold
# Traces: REQ-007 (rate limiting), DES-003 (RateLimiter component)
def test_rate_limiter_rejects_over_threshold():
    """Given a user at the rate limit, when they send another request,
    then the request is rejected with 429."""
    limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests=100, window_seconds=60)
    for _ in range(100):
        limiter.record_request(user_id="test-user")
    
    result = limiter.check_request(user_id="test-user")
    assert result.allowed is False
    assert result.retry_after > 0
```

### Step 4 — Execute (`--run`)

Run tests in an isolated environment:

1. **Full suite** (`--run`): Execute all tests, capture output
2. **Single test** (`--run TST-005`): Execute only the specified test
3. **By level** (`--run --level unit`): Execute tests at a specific level

Capture for each test run:
- Pass/fail status per test
- Execution time
- Stdout/stderr output
- Stack traces for failures

### Step 5 — Visual Testing (`--visual`)

For web and mobile projects:

1. **Capture screenshots** — Use Playwright to navigate to each page/view and capture screenshots
2. **Multimodal analysis** — Analyze screenshots for visual defects:
   - Layout issues (overlapping elements, misalignment)
   - Missing content (blank areas, broken images)
   - Styling anomalies (wrong colors, font issues)
   - Responsive issues (content overflow, hidden elements)
3. **Best-effort caveat** — Always note: "Visual analysis is best-effort. The agent identifies obvious issues but cannot guarantee detection of all visual defects. Human review of screenshots is recommended."
4. **Save screenshots** — Store in `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/test-reports/screenshots/`
5. **Video on failure** — If a test fails, capture video of the failing interaction

### Step 6 — Coverage (`--coverage`)

Generate code coverage report:

1. Run tests with coverage enabled:
   - Python: `uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term`
   - JS/TS: `npx vitest --coverage`
   - Go: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`
2. Parse coverage results:
   - Total line coverage percentage
   - Per-file coverage breakdown
   - Uncovered lines/branches
3. Compare against targets from strategy
4. Flag files below threshold

### Step 7 — Campaign Report (`--evidence`)

Generate a comprehensive test evidence package:

Save to `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/test-reports/campaign-{date}.md`:

```yaml
---
id: RVW-{NNN}
artefact_type: review
title: "Sprint {NN} Test Campaign — {date}"
sprint: {NN}
status: done
created: {date}
author: agent
traces:
  derives_from: [TST-{NNN}, ...]
---
```

Content includes:
- Test pyramid coverage vs targets
- Pass/fail summary by level
- Code coverage summary
- Requirements coverage matrix (which REQs have passing tests)
- Visual test results with screenshot references
- Failed tests with root cause analysis
- Recommendations for next sprint

### Step 8 — Update Health Metrics

Update `.gse/status.yaml` health dimensions with test metrics:

```yaml
testing:
  test_pass_rate: 95.2        # percentage of tests passing
  code_coverage: 82.1          # line coverage percentage
  requirements_coverage: 90.0  # percentage of REQs with at least one test
  last_run: "2026-01-20T14:30:00Z"
  tests_total: 42
  tests_passed: 40
  tests_failed: 2
  tests_skipped: 0
```

### Framework Drift Detection

On each `--run` or `--setup`:

1. Compare the currently installed test framework version against `.gse/config.yaml`
2. If version has changed (e.g., someone ran `npm update`):
   - Report: "Test framework version changed: vitest 2.0.1 -> 2.1.0"
   - Check for breaking changes in changelog
   - Propose updating config if compatible

### Dependency Audit

If enabled in `.gse/config.yaml` (`security.dependency_audit: true`):

1. Run audit tool:
   - Python: `uv run pip-audit`
   - JavaScript: `npm audit`
   - Go: `govulncheck ./...`
   - Rust: `cargo audit`
2. Report vulnerabilities by severity
3. Create TASK items in backlog for critical vulnerabilities
