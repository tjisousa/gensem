# GSE-One Task — Ad-hoc Task

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Options

| Flag / Sub-command | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `<description>`    | Free-text description of the task to execute |
| `--type TYPE`      | Force artefact type (feat/fix/doc/test/refactor/task) |
| `--complexity N`   | Override complexity estimate (1-5) |
| `--no-review`      | Mark task as not requiring review (for trivial tasks) |
| `--spike`          | Create a spike (exploratory experiment). Complexity-boxed (max 3 points), non-deliverable, bypasses REQS/TESTS guardrails, must produce a DEC- |
| `--help`           | Show this command's usage summary |

## Prerequisites

Before executing, read:
1. `.gse/status.yaml` — current sprint and lifecycle state
2. `.gse/config.yaml` — git strategy, complexity budget
3. `.gse/backlog.yaml` — current sprint backlog (to add the task)
4. `.gse/profile.yaml` — user expertise level

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Sprint Freeze Check (Hard guardrail)

Before any other work, verify the current sprint is writeable. This preflight implements the **Sprint Freeze** invariant defined in the orchestrator and the spec.

1. Read `.gse/plan.yaml`. If absent (Micro mode or pre-v0.20 projects), **skip this step** — proceed to Step 1.
2. If `plan.yaml.status == active`, proceed to Step 1.
3. If `plan.yaml.status ∈ {completed, abandoned}`, the current sprint is **frozen**. Do NOT write anything to `backlog.yaml` or `status.yaml`. Present the Sprint Freeze Gate:

   > **Question:** The current sprint (S{NN}) plan status is `{completed|abandoned}` — it is frozen. New ad-hoc tasks cannot be added to a frozen sprint.
   >
   > **Options:**
   > 1. **Start next sprint now** (recommended, default) — I'll run the next-sprint opening sequence: in Lightweight mode `/gse:plan --strategic`; in Full mode `/gse:collect` > `/gse:assess` > `/gse:plan --strategic`. Once Sprint S{NN+1} is active, I'll execute your task there.
   > 2. **Cancel** — Abort this `/gse:task` invocation. No changes will be made.
   > 3. **Discuss** — Explore the trade-offs of opening a new sprint vs. cancelling.

4. On option 1:
   - Invoke the mode-appropriate opening sequence inline (read `config.yaml → lifecycle.mode` to decide).
   - After `/gse:plan --strategic` completes, re-read `.gse/status.yaml → current_sprint` (it now holds `{NN+1}`) and re-read `.gse/plan.yaml → status` (it now holds `active`).
   - Proceed to Step 1 in the new sprint context.
5. On option 2: stop execution. No state change.
6. On option 3: explain the Sprint Freeze invariant briefly (*"A delivered sprint is immutable — complementary work goes into a successor sprint, often named 'Sprint N+1 — Complementary tasks'."*), then re-present the Gate (options 1-3 only).

### Step 1 — Task Analysis

1. Parse the task description from `$ARGUMENTS`
2. Infer artefact type from description if `--type` not provided:
   - `--spike` flag → `spike`
   - Keywords like "fix", "bug" -> `fix`
   - Keywords like "add", "create", "implement" -> `feat`
   - Keywords like "document", "readme", "comment" -> `doc`
   - Keywords like "test", "spec" -> `test`
   - Keywords like "refactor", "clean", "reorganize" -> `refactor`
   - Keywords like "spike", "experiment", "try", "explore", "prototype" -> `spike`
   - Default: `task`
3. Estimate complexity (1-5) if `--complexity` not provided:
   - 1: trivial change (typo, config tweak)
   - 2: small change (single file, straightforward)
   - 3: medium change (multiple files, some design)
   - 4: large change (new feature, cross-cutting)
   - 5: complex change (architectural impact)

### Step 2 — Budget Check

1. Read current sprint complexity budget from `status.yaml`
2. Check if the task fits within remaining budget
3. If budget would be exceeded:
   - Report: "This task (complexity {N}) would exceed the sprint budget (remaining: {M})."
   - Present Gate:
     - **Proceed** — Accept budget overrun
     - **Reduce scope** — Discuss a simpler version
     - **Defer** — Add to pool for next sprint
     - **Discuss** — Explore alternatives

### Step 3 — Add to Backlog

Create a new TASK entry in `backlog.yaml`:

```yaml
TASK-{next_id}:
  title: "{description}"
  artefact_type: {inferred_type}
  complexity: {estimated}
  sprint: S{current_NN}
  status: planned
  source: ad-hoc
  requires_review: {true unless --no-review or complexity <= 1}
  created_at: {timestamp}
```

**If `artefact_type: spike`:**
```yaml
TASK-{next_id}:
  title: "{description}"
  artefact_type: spike
  question: "{the technical question to answer}"
  complexity_cap: {estimated, max 3}
  complexity: {estimated}
  sprint: S{current_NN}
  status: planned
  source: ad-hoc
  requires_review: false
  deliverable: false          # cannot be merged to main
  outcome: pending            # → yes / no / partial after completion
  created_at: {timestamp}
```

**Spike rules:**
1. **Complexity-boxed** — maximum 3 points. If estimated > 3, reject: "A spike must stay small (max 3 complexity points). Split into a smaller experiment or create a normal task."
2. **Non-deliverable** — the spike branch is deleted after completion. Code cannot be merged to main. If reusable code emerges, create a normal TASK to implement properly with REQS/TESTS.
3. **Must produce DEC-** — at completion, the agent creates a DEC- artefact documenting: the question, the approach tried, the answer (yes/no/partial), and next steps.
4. **Beginner Gate** — if `it_expertise: beginner`, present a Gate before starting: "This is an experiment — the code won't be kept. It's useful to test an idea before committing to it. Should I proceed?"
5. **Bypasses REQS/TESTS guardrails** — the spike does not need requirements or test strategy. The question IS the requirement; the experiment IS the test.

### Step 4 — Git Setup

Create a dedicated branch and worktree following the same logic as `/gse:produce` Step 2:

- Branch name: `gse/sprint-{NN}/task/{slug}`
- Worktree: `.worktrees/sprint-{NN}-task-{slug}`

The git strategy (worktree/branch-only/none) is read from `config.yaml`.

### Step 5 — Execute Task

1. Execute the work described in the task
2. Commit at logical checkpoints:
   ```
   gse(sprint-{NN}/task): {description}

   Sprint: S{NN}
   Task: TASK-{ID}
   Source: ad-hoc
   ```

### Step 6 — Finalize

1. Update TASK in `backlog.yaml`:
   - `status: done`
   - `completed_at: {timestamp}`
2. Consume complexity budget: subtract task complexity from sprint remaining
3. Update `status.yaml`:
   - `last_activity: task`
   - `last_activity_timestamp: {now}`
   - `last_task: TASK-{ID}`
4. Review scheduling:
   - If `requires_review: true`: task will be included in next `/gse:review`
   - If `requires_review: false` (complexity <= 1 or `--no-review`): task is ready for delivery
5. Report task summary:
   - Task created and completed: TASK-{ID}
   - Complexity consumed: {N}
   - Remaining budget: {M}
   - Review required: {yes/no}
