# GSE-One Compound — Capitalization

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Options

| Flag / Sub-command | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| (no args)          | Run full capitalization across all 3 axes |
| `--axis project`   | Capitalize project learnings only (Axe 1) |
| `--axis methodology` | Capitalize methodology feedback only (Axe 2) |
| `--axis competencies` | Capitalize competency notes only (Axe 3) |
| `--learn`          | Proactively propose LEARN items for the user |
| `--help`           | Show this command's usage summary |

## Prerequisites

Before executing, read:
1. `.gse/status.yaml` — current sprint and lifecycle state
2. `.gse/config.yaml` — project configuration
3. `.gse/backlog.yaml` — completed sprint tasks and their history
4. `.gse/profile.yaml` — user profile, competency map, learning notes
5. `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/review.md` — review findings for the sprint
6. `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/release.md` — release notes (if delivery occurred)

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Axe 1: Project Capitalization

Analyze the sprint for project-level learnings:

1. **Patterns discovered** — Identify recurring code patterns, architectural decisions, or conventions that emerged during the sprint. Record as reusable patterns.

2. **Errors and anti-patterns** — Extract lessons from review findings (especially HIGH severity), failed tests, and fix cycles. Document what went wrong and how to prevent recurrence.

3. **Process deviation scan** — Read `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/review.md` and identify all findings tagged as process or methodology deviations (e.g., missing branches, missing test reports, skipped steps). For each deviation, create an explicit lesson in the Lessons Learned section of `compound.md` with: what the methodology expected, what actually happened, and the corrective action for future sprints. This ensures process issues are never silently ignored — they become documented, reusable lessons.

4. **Best practices confirmed** — Identify practices that worked well (clean test coverage, good naming, effective decomposition). Reinforce these as project conventions.

5. **Technical debt identified** — Flag shortcuts taken during the sprint that should be addressed in future sprints. Add to backlog pool with `artefact_type: refactor`.

6. Persist to `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/compound.md`:

```markdown
# Sprint S{NN} — Capitalization

## Patterns
- {pattern}: {description and when to apply}

## Lessons Learned
- {lesson}: {context and prevention strategy}

## Best Practices Confirmed
- {practice}: {evidence of effectiveness}

## Technical Debt
- {debt item}: {impact and remediation suggestion}
```

### Step 2 — Axe 2: Methodology Capitalization

Analyze what worked and what did not in the GSE-One methodology itself during this sprint:

1. **Effective practices** — Which GSE-One activities, principles, or agent perspectives added value?
2. **Friction points** — Where did the methodology slow down or add unnecessary ceremony?
3. **Missing capabilities** — What did the user need that GSE-One does not provide?
4. **Improvement proposals** — Concrete, actionable suggestions for GSE-One evolution

**Filtering criteria** (only propose issues that meet ALL):
- Actionable — has a clear implementation path
- Observed in 2+ sprints OR confirmed by user as important
- Not already reported (check existing issues if possible)

If proposals pass the filter:
1. Read `plugin.json` to get the `repository` field for the GSE-One repo
2. Present proposals to user (Gate): "I identified {N} methodology improvements. Shall I create issues on the GSE-One repository?"
3. If accepted, prepare issue drafts (actual creation happens in `/gse:integrate`)

### Step 3 — Axe 3: Competency Capitalization

Feed the user's learning journey:

1. **Update learning notes** — Based on sprint activity, aggregate contextual tips:
   - New tools or techniques the user encountered
   - Concepts that required explanation during the sprint
   - Skills demonstrated (evidence of growth)

2. **Update competency map** — In `profile.yaml`, adjust competency assessments:
   - Increase confidence for skills practiced successfully
   - Identify gaps revealed by sprint challenges
   - Suggest next learning targets

3. **Proactive LEARN proposals** — This is the natural moment to propose learning items:
   - "During this sprint, you worked with {topic}. Would you like me to add a learning note about {specific concept}?"
   - Present as low-pressure suggestions, not requirements

### Step 4 — Persist and Finalize

1. Write `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/compound.md` with all three axes
2. Update `status.yaml`:
   - `last_activity: compound`
   - `last_activity_timestamp: {now}`
   - `lifecycle_phase: LC03`
3. Report capitalization summary:
   - Patterns documented: {count}
   - Lessons learned: {count}
   - Methodology proposals: {count}
   - Learning notes added: {count}
4. Proceed to Step 5 (archival), then propose `/gse:integrate`

### Step 5 — Sprint Archival (scalability)

After capitalization, archive the completed sprint to keep state files lean:

1. **Backlog compaction** — Move all TASKs with `status: delivered` for the completed sprint from `backlog.yaml` to `backlog-archive.yaml` (same YAML format). This keeps the active backlog within ~200 lines.
   - For beginners: "I'll move the completed items to an archive so your task list stays clean."

2. **Sprint directory archival** — If there are more than 2 completed sprint directories in `docs/sprints/`, propose (Inform) moving older ones to `docs/archive/`:
   - Move `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/` → `docs/archive/sprint-{NN}/` for sprints older than current - 2
   - The 2 most recent sprints stay in `docs/sprints/` for easy reference

3. **Archive accessibility** — Archived data is not deleted, just moved. It remains accessible via `/gse:status --history` or by reading `docs/archive/` directly.

4. **Regenerate dashboard** — Run `python3 "$(cat ~/.gse-one)/tools/dashboard.py"` to update `docs/dashboard.html` with capitalization results, archived sprints, and updated health trends. Inform the user:
   - For beginners: "Le tableau de bord a été mis à jour avec le bilan de ce cycle. Tu peux le consulter pour voir l'historique complet du projet."
   - For intermediate/expert: "Dashboard updated with compound results and sprint history."

5. Propose next step: `/gse:integrate` to route solutions to their targets
