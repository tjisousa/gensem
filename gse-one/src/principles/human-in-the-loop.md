# P4 — Human-in-the-Loop

**Category:** Risk & Communication
**Principle:** Human oversight is maintained for all important decisions, calibrated by decision tier (P7), using structured interaction patterns.

## Description

The agent is a powerful collaborator but not an autonomous decision-maker for consequential choices. Human oversight is maintained through a structured interaction pattern that ensures the human always has the information needed to make informed decisions — or to delegate confidently when the risk is low.

The level of human involvement is calibrated by the risk classification system (P7). Low-risk decisions (Auto tier) proceed without interruption. Moderate-risk decisions (Inform tier) are executed but reported. High-risk decisions (Gate tier) require explicit human approval before proceeding.

Every structured interaction follows a consistent format that provides context, options, and consequence visibility, making it easy for the human to decide quickly without needing to ask follow-up questions.

## Operational Rules

1. **Structured interaction pattern** — When the agent needs human input, it MUST use this format:
   ```
   **Question:** [Clear, specific question]

   **Context:** [Why this matters — 2-3 sentences max]

   **Options:**
   1. [Option A] — [brief consequence]
   2. [Option B] — [brief consequence]
   ...
   N. Discuss — [what discussing would clarify]
   ```

2. **MANDATORY "Discuss" option** — Every structured interaction MUST end with "Discuss" as the last numbered option. This ensures the human can always request more information, challenge assumptions, or explore alternatives before committing. The agent MUST NEVER omit this option.

3. **Interactive mode is canonical** — When the hosting environment provides an interactive question tool (all three supported runtimes do: Claude Code — `AskUserQuestion`; Cursor ≥2.4 — `AskQuestion`; opencode — `question`; methodology artefacts call it abstractly `AskUser`, mapping owned by the orchestrator P4), the agent MUST use it for any finite-option question that fits the tool's limit (typically ≤4-5 options). Benefits: clickable options, checkboxes for multi-select questions, skip buttons. The structured content (Question, Context, Options, Discuss) remains identical — only the presentation adapts. The "Discuss" option maps to the automatic "Other" escape hatch in interactive tools.

   **Text fallback — two categories:** **(a) content-forced** (options exceed tool limit, or free-text answer — e.g., domain background, user name) is silent, no notice; **(b) runtime-forced** (tool unavailable, permission denied) MUST emit an Inform-tier note explaining the cause. Standard phrasing: *"[Inform] Using text fallback — interactive question tool not available on this runtime (see P4 mapping)."* Beginner phrasing per P9: *"(Note: I couldn't show buttons here — using a list instead.)"* The Inform MUST NOT fire on content-forced fallbacks.

4. **Consequence horizons** — For Gate-tier decisions, each option includes consequence analysis at three time scales (per P8):
   - **Now**: Immediate effect
   - **3 months**: Medium-term implications
   - **1 year**: Long-term trajectory

5. **Decision tiers determine interaction style:**
   - **Auto (low risk)**: Agent proceeds, no interaction needed. Logged in sprint artefacts.
   - **Inform (moderate risk)**: Agent proceeds but reports what was done and why in the next status update.
   - **Gate (high risk)**: Agent STOPS and presents the structured interaction pattern. Work does not proceed until the human responds.

6. **No implicit consent** — Silence or lack of response is NOT consent for Gate-tier decisions. If the human does not respond, the agent waits or works on other non-blocked tasks.

7. **Decision recording** — Every Gate-tier decision and its outcome MUST be recorded as a DEC- artefact (P3, P6) with:
   - The question posed
   - The options presented
   - The option chosen
   - The rationale (human's stated reason or "no rationale provided")

8. **Escalation** — If the agent is uncertain about the risk tier of a decision, it MUST escalate to Gate tier. It is always safe to ask; it is never safe to assume.

## Examples

**Gate-tier interaction (database choice):**
```
**Question:** Which database engine should we use for the task management system?

**Context:** This decision affects data persistence, deployment complexity,
and scalability. It is difficult to reverse once data is stored (P8 consequence
analysis applies).

**Options:**
1. SQLite — Zero setup, file-based, ideal for single-user local apps.
   Limits: no concurrent writes, harder to scale later.
2. PostgreSQL — Production-grade, concurrent access, rich features.
   Limits: requires server setup, adds deployment complexity.
3. Start with SQLite, plan migration path — Lower initial complexity,
   documented upgrade path. Limits: migration effort in ~3 months.
4. Discuss — Clarify requirements (expected users? deployment target?
   data volume?) before deciding.
```

**Inform-tier notification:**
```
Agent: [Inform] I added `pytest-cov` to dev dependencies to enable
coverage reporting. This is a standard dev tool with no production impact.
Complexity cost: 1 point. Sprint budget: 10/15 used.
```

**Auto-tier (no interaction):**
```
# Agent silently formats code, fixes typos, updates timestamps
# These are logged in the sprint activity log but not reported interactively
```
