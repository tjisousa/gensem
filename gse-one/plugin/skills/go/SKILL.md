# GSE-One Go — Orchestrate

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Options

| Flag / Sub-command | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| (no args)          | Detect current project state and propose the next activity |
| `--adopt`          | Adopt an existing project that was not created with GSE-One |
| `--status`         | Display current state without proposing an action |
| `--help`           | Show this command's usage summary |

## Prerequisites

Before executing, read:
1. `.gse/status.yaml` — current sprint and lifecycle state (if it exists)
2. `.gse/config.yaml` — project configuration (if it exists)
3. `.gse/backlog.yaml` — work items and their statuses (if it exists)
4. `.gse/profile.yaml` — user profile (if it exists)


## Workflow

### Step 1 — Detect Project State

Examine the working directory to classify the situation.

**"Project files" definition:** Only count files that belong to the actual project. **Exclude** the following directories from the file count — they are tool/IDE configuration, not project content:
- `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.gse/` — agent/plugin artifacts
- `.git/` — version control internals
- `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.fleet/` — IDE settings
- `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `dist/`, `build/` — generated/dependency directories

| Condition | State | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| No `.gse/` directory AND project files exist (after exclusions) | **Adopt candidate** | Transition to Adopt mode (Step 8) |
| No `.gse/` directory AND directory is empty/near-empty (only excluded dirs) | **New project** | **Automatically execute** `/gse:hug` (do NOT just propose it — run it directly). No preamble, no table, no technical explanation. |
| `.gse/` exists | **Existing project** | Read `status.yaml` and proceed to Step 2 |

**New project auto-start rule:** When the project is empty, the user's intent is clear — they want to get started. The agent MUST immediately execute the HUG skill inline (language question first, then profile interview) without asking for confirmation or displaying diagnostic output. The user should see the HUG language question as the very first interaction, not a status table.

### Step 2 — Recovery Check (Unsaved Work Detection)

If `.gse/` exists, scan for unsaved work before proceeding:

1. **Check worktrees** — For each worktree listed in `config.yaml → git.worktree_dir` (default `.worktrees/`), run `git status`. Detect uncommitted changes.
2. **Check main working directory** — Run `git status` on the project root.
3. **If uncommitted changes are found:**
   - Report clearly: *"I found unsaved changes in N worktree(s). This usually means the previous session ended without `/gse:pause`."*
   - List each worktree with changes (branch name, number of modified files)
   - Present Gate decision:
     - **Recover** (default) — Auto-commit changes with message `gse(recovery): checkpoint — unsaved work from previous session`
     - **Review first** — Show the diff before committing
     - **Discard** — Discard uncommitted changes (confirm twice — destructive)
     - **Skip** — Continue without committing (changes remain uncommitted)
4. **If no uncommitted changes** — Proceed silently (no message).

### Step 3 — Determine Next Action (Decision Tree)

Read `status.yaml` fields: `current_sprint`, `lifecycle_phase`, `last_activity`, `last_activity_timestamp`.

Evaluate states **in order** — the first matching row wins.

| Current State | Proposed Action |
|---------------|-----------------|
| No sprint defined | Sub-decision below |
| Plan exists, not approved | Resume PLAN — present plan summary, ask for approval Gate |
| Plan approved, **no requirements** (`reqs.md` absent or empty) | Start REQS — **test-driven requirements**: every REQ MUST include testable acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then or equivalent) and identify open technical questions. These criteria become the spec for validation tests. **Hard guardrail: PRODUCE MUST NOT start until REQS exist.** |
| Reqs done, **no design** (optional) | If tasks involve architecture decisions (new data model, API design, component structure): start DESIGN. Otherwise: proceed to PREVIEW or TESTS. |
| Design done (or skipped), **no preview** and `project_domain` is `web` or `mobile` | Start PREVIEW — show mockup/prototype for user validation before coding. For CLI/API/data/embedded: skip silently. |
| Design + preview done (or skipped), **no test strategy** (no `test-strategy.md`) | Start TESTS `--strategy` — define test pyramid: verification tests (from DESIGN) + validation tests (from REQS acceptance criteria). |
| Tasks ready (reqs + design + test strategy + preview done or skipped), none in-progress | Start PRODUCE on first planned TASK |
| Tasks with status `in-progress` | Resume PRODUCE — show current task, propose continuation |
| All sprint tasks `done`, no review | Start REVIEW — propose `/gse:review` |
| Review done, fixes pending | Start FIX — propose `/gse:fix` |
| All tasks delivered, no compound | Start LC03 — propose `/gse:compound` |
| Compound done | Propose next sprint — increment sprint number, transition to LC01 (`COLLECT` > `ASSESS` > `PLAN`) |

**"No sprint defined" sub-decision** (evaluated in order):
1. If `it_expertise: beginner` and `current_sprint: 0` (first time) → start **Intent-First mode** (Step 7)
2. If the project has < 5 actual project files (using Step 1 exclusion rules) → propose **Lightweight mode** (Step 6)
3. Otherwise → start full **LC01**: `/gse:collect` > `/gse:assess` > `/gse:plan --strategic`

**Lifecycle guardrails (Hard — cannot be skipped):**
1. **No PRODUCE without REQS** — No TASK can move to `in-progress` unless at least one REQ- artefact with testable acceptance criteria is traced to it. REQS is test-driven: acceptance criteria ARE the future validation test specs.
2. **No PRODUCE without test strategy** — The test approach (verification from DESIGN + validation from REQS acceptance criteria) must be defined before coding starts. Test strategy comes AFTER DESIGN and PREVIEW.
3. **Supervised mode enforcement** — When `decision_involvement: supervised`, ANY technical choice during PRODUCE (library, data format, folder structure, persistence, API design) MUST be a Gate decision. The agent MUST NOT make these choices silently.

Present the proposal and wait for user confirmation before executing.

### Step 4 — Stale Sprint Detection

Read `config.yaml → lifecycle.stale_sprint_sessions` (default: 3 sessions).

Track the number of sessions (invocations of `/gse:go` or `/gse:resume`) where no TASK has progressed to a new status. A "progression" is any TASK moving from one status to the next (open→planned, planned→in-progress, in-progress→done, etc.).

If the session-without-progress count reaches the configured threshold:

1. Report: "Sprint {NN} has had {N} sessions without progress."
2. Present Gate decision:
   - **Resume** — Continue where we left off (default)
   - **Partial delivery** — Deliver completed tasks, move remaining to pool
   - **Discard** — Abandon sprint, return all tasks to pool
   - **Discuss** — Explain the situation and help decide

### Step 5 — Failure Handling

If the last activity ended with an error or incomplete state:

1. Create a checkpoint of current state
2. Report what failed and why (if determinable)
3. Present Gate decision:
   - **Retry** — Re-attempt the failed activity
   - **Skip** — Mark as skipped, proceed to next activity
   - **Pause** — Save state and stop (user will return later)
   - **Discuss** — Explore alternatives

### Step 6 — Lightweight Mode Detection

**Trigger:** Reached from Step 3 when no sprint is defined and the project has < 5 actual project files (using Step 1 exclusion rules). At this point `.gse/` already exists (created by HUG or adopt).

1. Propose lightweight mode (Inform tier — user can override to full):
   "This is a small project. I recommend lightweight mode — reduced overhead while preserving traceability."
2. Operational restrictions in lightweight mode (spec Section 13.2):

| Aspect | Full Mode | Lightweight Mode |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Lifecycle | LC01 > LC02 > LC03 | PLAN > PRODUCE > DELIVER |
| Git strategy | `worktree` (sprint + feature branches) | `branch-only` (single feature branch from main, no sprint branch) |
| Sprint artefacts | Full set (plan, reqs, design, tests, review, compound) | Plan only (inline in `.gse/status.yaml`, no separate file) |
| Health dashboard | 8 dimensions | 3 only (test_pass_rate, review_findings, git_hygiene) |
| Complexity budget | Tracked | Not tracked |
| Decision tiers | Full P7 assessment (Auto + Inform + Gate) | Simplified (Auto + Gate only, no Inform) |

3. User can upgrade to full mode anytime via `/gse:go` — the agent scaffolds the missing structure.
4. **Minimum viable project size:** For truly one-off tasks (single script, quick fix), using GSE-One adds more overhead than value. Suggest working without GSE-One and adopting later if the project grows.

### Step 7 — Intent-First Mode (Beginner + First Sprint)

**Trigger:** Reached from Step 3 when `it_expertise: beginner` and `current_sprint: 0` (first time through LC01). At this point `.gse/` exists with a profile from HUG.

The orchestrator enters a conversational mode to clarify the user's intent before starting the formal lifecycle:

1. **Elicit intent** — Ask in simple terms:
   *"Describe in a few sentences what you'd like to build or achieve."*
   Let the user express freely. Do not ask for technical details.

2. **Reformulate and validate** — Translate the intent into a structured summary using the user's vocabulary (no jargon):
   *"If I understand correctly, you want: [bulleted list in plain language]. Is that right?"*
   Iterate until the user confirms.

3. **Translate to backlog** — Convert the validated intent into initial TASK items in `backlog.yaml`. Present them as concrete goals, not technical work items:
   *"Here's what we'll work on: [list of goals]. I'll guide you through each step."*

4. **Transition to LC01** — Enter the normal lifecycle (`COLLECT` > `ASSESS` > `PLAN`), but present each activity in plain language:
   - COLLECT → *"Let me look at what we have to work with"*
   - ASSESS → *"Let me figure out what's missing"*
   - PLAN → *"Let me organize the work into manageable steps"*
   - REQS → *"Let me write down exactly what the application should do"*
   - PRODUCE → *"Now I'll build it"*
   - REVIEW → *"Let me check my own work for mistakes"*
   - DELIVER → *"Let me finalize and package the result"*

5. **Exit condition** — The user can say *"I know the process, let's skip ahead"* at any point. The agent switches to normal orchestration immediately and updates the profile: `it_expertise: intermediate`.

### Step 8 — Adopt Mode (`--adopt`)

**Trigger:** Reached from Step 1 (auto-detected: no `.gse/` + project files exist) or via explicit `--adopt` flag.

**Guard:** If `--adopt` is used but `.gse/` already exists, warn: "This project already has GSE-One state. Use `/gse:go` without `--adopt` to continue, or delete `.gse/` first to re-adopt from scratch." Do NOT proceed.

**Non-destructive guarantee:** The adopt flow NEVER modifies existing files without explicit user approval. It can be interrupted and resumed at any point.

1. **Identify** — Detect language/framework from manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.)
2. **Scan** — Run `/gse:collect` (internal mode) to inventory all existing artefacts
3. **Infer state** — Analyze git history to estimate:
   - How many sprints of work exist (commits, age, tags)
   - What was the last stable release (latest tag)
   - Are there lingering branches
   - Project domain from dependencies
   - Git strategy from existing branch patterns
   - Team context from git log (multiple committers?)
4. **Initialize** — Create `.gse/` directory with:
   - `config.yaml` — populated with inferred domain and git strategy
   - `status.yaml` — set to `current_sprint: 0`, `current_phase: LC01`
   - `backlog.yaml` — empty, ready for population
   - `profile.yaml` — trigger `/gse:hug` if no profile exists
5. **Set baseline** — Record current state as **sprint 0** — the starting point for the first GSE-managed sprint. Current `main` HEAD is the baseline.
6. **Propose annotation** (Gate decision):
   ```
   I found N existing artefacts. Add GSE-One traceability metadata?
   1. Yes, annotate all — add YAML frontmatter to existing .md files
   2. Annotate new artefacts only — leave existing files untouched
   3. Skip annotation entirely
   4. Discuss
   ```
7. **Transition** — Proceed to normal LC01 for sprint 1: `COLLECT` > `ASSESS` > `PLAN`
