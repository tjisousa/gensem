## Prerequisites

Before executing, read:
1. `.gse/profile.yaml` — user profile (especially `learning_goals`, `it_expertise`, `abstraction_capability`, `preferred_verbosity`)
2. `.gse/profile.yaml` → `competency_map.topics` — topics already explained
3. `docs/learning/` — existing learning notes (if any)

## Workflow

### Mode Selection

Three learning modes are available:

| Mode | Duration | Depth | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Quick** | ~5 min | Core concept + 1 example | Default for reactive requests, good for filling a specific gap |
| **Deep** | ~15 min | Theory + examples + exercises + connections | When user says "explain in detail", "I want to understand deeply" |
| **Roadmap** | ~2 min | Map of known/unknown topics + suggested path | When user says "what should I learn", "where are my gaps" |

Mode is determined by: explicit flag > user phrasing > default (quick).

> **Workflow structure note.** `/gse:learn` exposes two disjoint workflows (Reactive — user-initiated; Proactive — agent-initiated via the coach pedagogy axis). Each workflow defines its own Step sequence (`#### Step 1..N`), numbering resets per workflow. Only one workflow runs per invocation. This **multi-mode `### Mode → #### Step N` structure** is shared with `/gse:backlog`, `/gse:plan`, `/gse:collect`; see CLAUDE.md — §Activity structural conventions for the full catalog.

### Reactive Workflow (User-Initiated)

Triggered when the user explicitly asks to learn something.

#### Step 1 — Check Existing Note

Search `docs/learning/` for an existing note on the topic:
- If found and recent (created or updated in the current or previous sprint): offer to show it or go deeper
- If found and stale (not updated in > 3 sprints): offer to refresh it
- If not found: proceed to generate

#### Step 2 — Determine Mode

- `--quick` or `--deep` flag → use that mode
- User said "explain", "what is", "quick overview" → quick mode
- User said "teach me", "deep dive", "I want to understand" → deep mode
- User said "what should I learn", "roadmap" → roadmap mode

#### Step 3 — Generate Calibrated Content

Content is calibrated using the user profile:

| Profile Dimension | Content Adaptation |
|------------------|--------------------|
| `it_expertise` | Technical depth, assumed prerequisites |
| `abstraction_capability` | Examples-first (concrete) vs theory-first (abstract) |
| `preferred_verbosity` | Length and detail level |
| `language.chat` | Language of explanation |

_See spec §P14 "P14 preamble — 5-option format (canonical)" for the shared 5-option Gate used across coach / `/gse:learn` / orchestrator preambles._

**Quick mode structure:**
1. One-sentence definition
2. Why it matters (in the context of the current project)
3. One concrete example (from the project if possible)
4. One common pitfall
5. Link to deeper resources

**Deep mode structure:**
1. Concept overview and motivation
2. Core theory (with diagrams if applicable)
3. Worked example from the current project
4. Second example showing edge case
5. Practice exercise
6. Connections to related concepts
7. Common pitfalls and misconceptions
8. Further reading

**Roadmap mode structure:**
1. Competency map visualization (known/partial/unknown)
2. Suggested learning path ordered by relevance to current sprint
3. Estimated time investment per topic
4. Dependencies between topics

#### Step 4 — Save Learning Note

Create a learning note artefact:

```yaml
---
id: LRN-{NNN}
artefact_type: learning
title: "{Topic}"
topic: {topic-slug}                     # short slug, same as filename stem (e.g., property-based-testing)
sprint: {current_sprint}
status: done
mode: {contextual | quick | deep}       # 3 values per spec §P14 — Knowledge Transfer (Coaching)
trigger: {reactive | proactive | contextual}  # how the learning episode was initiated (spec §P14)
related_activity: {/gse:activity}       # activity context (e.g., /gse:deliver, /gse:produce)
author: agent                            # agent | pair (human/agent co-authored)
created: {date}
traces:
  triggered_by: [TASK-{NNN}]            # task during which the opportunity arose (if any)
  derives_from: [DEC-{NNN}, TASK-{NNN}] # artefacts that motivated this lesson (optional)
---
```

Save to `docs/learning/LRN-{NNN}-{topic-slug}.md`.

#### Step 5 — Update Competency Map

Update `.gse/profile.yaml` → `competency_map.topics`:

```yaml
topics:
  git-rebase:
    level: explained  # not-seen | mentioned | explained | practiced
    last_session: 2026-01-15
    mode: deep
    note: LRN-003
  dependency-injection:
    level: mentioned
    last_session: 2026-01-10
    mode: quick
    note: LRN-001
```

### Proactive Workflow (Agent-Initiated)

Proactive learning proposals are driven by the **coach agent's pedagogy axis (axis 1)**. The coach is invoked by the orchestrator at documented moments (any lifecycle activity start with `learning_goals` non-empty, `/gse:compound` Axe 3, detected inferred gaps, etc.). See:

- **`plugin/agents/coach.md`** — authoritative specification of the 8 coach axes, invocation contract, anti-spam safeguards, coaching recipes.
- **design §5.17** — coach invocation moments, persistence model, output schema.
- **spec §P14** — 5-option P14 preamble canonical format + 7 workflow monitoring axes.

`/gse:learn` handles **direct user invocation** (Reactive Workflow, above). The Proactive path is owned by the coach — `/gse:learn` does not duplicate its trigger logic here.

#### Structured Interaction Pattern (canonical — spec §P14)

When the coach (or `/gse:learn`) proposes a topic, it presents the 5-option P14 Gate:

```
Agent: We're about to define API contracts. I notice "REST design patterns"
isn't in your competency map. Would you like to:

1. Quick overview (5 min) — concise introduction
2. Deep session (15 min) — worked example + practice
3. Not now — remind me next sprint
4. Not interested — don't propose this topic again
5. Discuss — tell me more before I decide
```

On acceptance (option 1 or 2), `/gse:learn` runs in Reactive mode to generate and persist the LRN-. Options 3 and 4 are recorded in `status.yaml → learning_preambles[]` to avoid re-proposing.

#### Guardrails (enforced by the coach)

- **Max 1 proposal per activity phase** — Never interrupt the same activity twice
- **Respect user pace** — "Not now" for a topic: no re-proposal in the same sprint; "Not interested": permanent topic-level suppress
- **Contextual relevance** — Only propose topics directly relevant to the current or next task

### Contextual Tips (Inline Micro-Explanations)

When `contextual_tips: on` in user profile:

After any action that involves a technical concept:

1. Check `profile.yaml` → `competency_map.topics` — has this concept been explained?
2. If not explained: insert 2-3 sentences of context after the action output
3. Mark as `mentioned` in competency map (not `explained` — that requires a full session)

Example:
```
Agent: Created branch `gse/sprint-01/feat/user-auth` from `main`.

> Tip: Branch naming follows the convention `gse/sprint-NN/type/name`.
> The `feat/` prefix indicates a feature branch. Other prefixes include
> `fix/` for bug fixes and `refactor/` for restructuring.
```
