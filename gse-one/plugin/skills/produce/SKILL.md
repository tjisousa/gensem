# GSE-One Produce — Production

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Options

| Flag / Sub-command | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| (no args)          | Execute next pending task from current sprint backlog |
| `--task TASK-ID`   | Execute a specific task by ID |
| `--all`            | Execute all pending tasks sequentially |
| `--dry-run`        | Show what would be produced without executing |
| `--skip-tests`     | Skip automatic test execution after production (**Gate guardrail** — requires confirmation, logged as DEC-, penalizes health score) |
| `--help`           | Show this command's usage summary |

## Prerequisites

Before executing, read:
1. `.gse/status.yaml` — current sprint and lifecycle state
2. `.gse/config.yaml` — project configuration, especially `git.strategy` (worktree/branch-only/none)
3. `.gse/backlog.yaml` — sprint tasks, their status, and assignment
4. `.gse/profile.yaml` — user expertise level (affects test generation behavior)
5. `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/reqs.md` — requirements for the current sprint (**mandatory**)
6. `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/test-strategy.md` — test strategy (**mandatory**)


## Execution Model

**PRODUCE is an isolated activity** — the orchestrator delegates each TASK to a **sub-agent with a fresh context** (see Context Architecture in the orchestrator). This ensures the production phase has a clean context window, uncluttered by prior COLLECT/ASSESS/PLAN/REQS/DESIGN discussions.

**Before delegation**, the orchestrator:
1. Saves a mini-checkpoint (`.gse/checkpoints/pre-produce-{timestamp}.yaml`)
2. Spawns a sub-agent with: this SKILL.md, state files, sprint artefacts (reqs.md, design.md, test-strategy.md), and the TASK description
3. Claude Code: `Agent` tool with `isolation: "worktree"` (if worktree strategy)
4. Cursor: subagent with isolated context

**After delegation**, the orchestrator reads updated state files and displays the production summary to the user.

If `--all` is specified, each TASK is delegated to its own sub-agent **sequentially** (parallel PRODUCE is not supported — tasks may have dependencies).

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Pre-production Guardrails (Hard — cannot be skipped)

Before starting ANY task, verify these conditions. If any check fails, **STOP and do not proceed**.

**Sprint Freeze Check** (applied before all other Step 0 guardrails) — Read `.gse/plan.yaml`. If absent (Micro mode), skip this check. If `plan.yaml.status == active`, proceed to the numbered guardrails below. If `plan.yaml.status ∈ {completed, abandoned}`, the current sprint is **frozen**: do NOT transition any TASK forward and do NOT write to `backlog.yaml`. Present the Sprint Freeze Gate:

> **Question:** The current sprint (S{NN}) plan status is `{completed|abandoned}` — it is frozen. Production work cannot continue in a frozen sprint.
>
> **Options:**
> 1. **Start next sprint now** (recommended, default) — I'll run the next-sprint opening sequence: in Lightweight mode `/gse:plan --strategic`; in Full mode `/gse:collect` > `/gse:assess` > `/gse:plan --strategic`. Once Sprint S{NN+1} is active, I'll carry the planned production work into it.
> 2. **Cancel** — Abort this `/gse:produce` invocation. No changes will be made.
> 3. **Discuss** — Explore the trade-offs.

On option 1: invoke the mode-appropriate opening sequence inline; after promotion, re-read `.gse/status.yaml → current_sprint` and `.gse/plan.yaml → status`, then proceed to the numbered guardrails below in the new sprint context. On option 2: stop execution. On option 3: explain the Sprint Freeze invariant, then re-present the Gate.

**Standard guardrails (applied after Sprint Freeze passes):**

1. **Requirements check (Full and Lightweight)** — Verify that `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/reqs.md` exists and contains at least one REQ- artefact traced to the TASK about to start. If missing: report "Requirements not defined for this task. I need to write down what the app should do first." Then run REQS. **Exception:** Micro mode and `artefact_type: spike` — skip this check.
2. **Test strategy check (mode-differentiated):**
   - **Full mode:** Verify that a test strategy exists (`docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/test-strategy.md` or `tests` in `.gse/plan.yaml.workflow.completed`). If missing → **Hard guardrail.** Report "Test strategy not defined. I need to describe how we'll verify each feature works." Then run TESTS `--strategy`.
   - **Lightweight mode:** If no test strategy exists → **Soft guardrail (Inform).** Auto-generate a minimal test strategy based on `config.yaml → project.domain` (default test pyramid, no formal artefact). Log in `plan.yaml.coherence` as auto-generated. Continue without blocking.
   - **Micro mode:** Skip this check.
   **Exception: `artefact_type: spike`** — skip this check in all modes.
3. **Preview check (web/mobile only)** — If `config.yaml → project.domain` is `web` or `mobile` and no preview artefact exists (`docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/preview.md` or equivalent), present a Gate: "A preview was not done for this project. For a visual project, it's recommended to validate the look before coding." Options: **Proceed without preview** / **Run preview first** / **Discuss**. For beginners: "Before I build, it's helpful to show you a sketch of what the app will look like — want me to do that first?" **Exception: `artefact_type: spike`** — skip this check.
4. **Upstream test-review findings check** (spec §6.5) — If `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/review.md` exists, scan for unresolved findings tagged `[STRATEGY]` or `[TST-SPEC]` with severity HIGH. If any exist, **Hard guardrail: block production**. Report: "Tests were reviewed upstream and HIGH findings remain open. Resolve them first — writing code against an incorrect test plan wastes the sprint." List the open findings and their IDs. Redirect the user to `/gse:fix --severity HIGH --task TASK-upstream` or manual resolution of the strategy/spec. **Exception: `artefact_type: spike`** — skip this check.

**Decision tier override:**
5. **Supervised mode** — If `profile.decision_involvement` is `supervised`, ALL technical choices in this TASK are escalated to **Gate-tier** decisions. This includes: library/dependency selection, data format, folder structure, persistence strategy, API design, naming conventions. The agent MUST present options and wait for user confirmation — it MUST NOT make these choices silently.

### Step 1 — Select Task

**If the preceding PREVIEW used the scaffold-as-preview variant** (detectable by `preview_variant: scaffold` in `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/preview.md` frontmatter), perform an **Inform-tier scan** of residual placeholder markers before task selection:

```bash
grep -rn "PREVIEW:" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" \
  --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.html" --include="*.css" \
  --include="*.rb" --include="*.go" --include="*.rs" --include="*.java" \
  --include="*.kt" --include="*.swift" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.yml" .
```

Report the count per file (one-line summary) and remind the user that these placeholders should be replaced during PRODUCE. This is NOT a guardrail — it's a visibility cue. The user decides when/how to replace them during the TASKs selected below.

If the count is zero (all placeholders already replaced in a previous PRODUCE pass), mention it briefly and move on.

Read `backlog.yaml` and identify tasks for the current sprint with `status: planned`.

If multiple tasks are pending:
1. Sort by priority (P1 > P2 > P3), then by dependency order
2. Present the next task to produce with summary: ID, title, artefact_type, estimated complexity
3. Wait for user confirmation (Gate) unless `--all` was specified

If no tasks are pending:
1. Report: "All tasks for sprint S{NN} are complete or in-progress."
2. Propose `/gse:review` if unreviewed tasks exist, otherwise `/gse:deliver`

### Step 2 — Git Setup (Before Production)

**Precondition — git baseline:** If `git.strategy` is `worktree` or `branch-only`, verify `main` has at least one commit (`git rev-parse --verify main`). If not → **Hard guardrail**: "The repository has no foundational commit. Run `/gse:hug` or `/gse:go` to initialize it before producing."

**Git branch check:** Before starting work on any TASK, verify that the current branch is NOT `main`. If on `main`, remind the user that the methodology recommends working on a dedicated branch and create one per the convention below. If the user explicitly chooses to stay on `main`, respect the choice and note it as a known process deviation in the sprint review.

Read `config.yaml` field `git.strategy` and branch accordingly.

**Config Application Transparency (Inform, spec P7):** before creating the first branch or worktree of this TASK, emit a one-line Inform note labelling the applied config value. Compare the current `git.strategy` value against the methodology default (`worktree` per `gse-one/src/templates/config.yaml`) to compute the origin:

- If `git.strategy == worktree` (methodology default):
  *"Config applied: `git.strategy` = `worktree` (methodology default — to change: `/gse:hug --update` or edit `.gse/config.yaml`). I will create a separate workspace directory for each task."*
- If `git.strategy == branch-only`:
  *"Config applied: `git.strategy` = `branch-only` (user choice — to change: `/gse:hug --update` or edit `.gse/config.yaml`). I will create feature branches and switch between them in the main checkout."*
- If `git.strategy == none`:
  *"Config applied: `git.strategy` = `none` (user choice — to change: `/gse:hug --update` or edit `.gse/config.yaml`). I will commit directly on the current branch without creating dedicated branches."*

**Beginner adaptation (P9):** replace the technical note with plain language — e.g., *"I'm using separate folders for each task (default setup — say 'I'd prefer a simpler setup' if you want to change)."*

Emit the note ONCE per activity invocation, before the first branch/worktree creation. Do not repeat on subsequent TASKs of the same sprint.

#### Strategy: `worktree` (default)

1. Determine the sprint integration branch: `gse/sprint-{NN}/integration`
2. Create feature branch from sprint integration branch:
   ```
   git branch gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name} gse/sprint-{NN}/integration
   ```
   Where `{type}` is the artefact type (feat, fix, doc, test, refactor) and `{name}` is a slug of the task title.
3. Create worktree for the feature branch:
   ```
   git worktree add .worktrees/sprint-{NN}-{type}-{name} gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}
   ```
4. Update the TASK in `backlog.yaml`:
   - `status: in-progress`
   - `git.branch: gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}`
   - `git.branch_status: active`
   - `git.worktree: .worktrees/sprint-{NN}-{type}-{name}`
   - `git.worktree_status: active`
5. All subsequent file operations happen inside the worktree directory.

#### Strategy: `branch-only`

1. Determine base branch:
   - If sprint integration branch `gse/sprint-{NN}/integration` exists (full mode): branch from it.
   - If no sprint branch exists (Lightweight mode): branch from `main` directly.
2. Create feature branch:
   ```
   # Full mode:
   git branch gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name} gse/sprint-{NN}/integration
   git checkout gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}

   # Lightweight mode (no sprint branch):
   git branch gse/{type}/{name} main
   git checkout gse/{type}/{name}
   ```
3. Update the TASK in `backlog.yaml`:
   - `status: in-progress`
   - `git.branch: gse/sprint-{NN}/{type}/{name}` (full) or `gse/{type}/{name}` (lightweight)
   - `git.branch_status: active`

#### Strategy: `none`

1. Work directly on current branch (no branch creation).
2. Update the TASK in `backlog.yaml`:
   - `status: in-progress`

#### Record activity start SHA (all strategies)

After the branch/worktree is ready (or immediately, in the `none` strategy), record the baseline for the later Scope Reconciliation check (spec P6):

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Save the result to `.gse/status.yaml → activity_start_sha`. This will be used in Step 4.5 to compute the activity's file-level contribution via `git diff --name-status {activity_start_sha}..HEAD`. **Skip this recording** in Micro mode or when `git.strategy: none` AND the repository has no commits — the reconciliation step will then skip too.

### Step 3 — Execute Production

Produce the artefact according to the task specification:

1. Read the task description and acceptance criteria from `backlog.yaml`
2. If the task references requirements (REQ-NNN), read them from the requirements artefact
3. If the task references design decisions (DES-NNN), read them from the design artefact
4. Execute the work, creating or modifying files as specified
5. **Pre-commit self-review (P16 — before every commit):**
   Before committing, the agent MUST run these 5 checks on the changes about to be committed:
   - **(a) Hallucination hunt** — verify that all referenced APIs, libraries, and functions actually exist in the versions used
   - **(b) Assumption check** — list any assumptions made during implementation; flag those not validated by a REQ-
   - **(c) Complaisance check** — does the code match exactly what was asked in the requirements? No extra features, no missing features?
   - **(d) Edge cases** — have boundary conditions been considered (empty input, max values, concurrent access, error states)?
   - **(e) Temporal validity** — are the dependency versions, API endpoints, and syntax current and not deprecated?
   If any check fails, fix before committing. If uncertain, flag as a finding for REVIEW.
6. Commit at logical checkpoints using the convention:
   ```
   gse(sprint-{NN}/{type}): description

   Sprint: {NN}
   Task: TASK-{ID}
   Traces: [REQ-NNN, DES-NNN] (if applicable)
   ```

### Step 4 — Test Execution (After Production)

PRODUCE invokes the **canonical test run** defined in spec §6.3. The seven canonical steps (execute → capture → save → TCP report → test_evidence → inline summary → health update) are never skipped and never duplicated here. This step only documents the PRODUCE-specific pre/post-conditions around that canonical call.

**Pre-condition A — `--skip-tests` flag:**
1. Present a **Gate decision** (cannot be silently bypassed): "Skipping tests means we won't verify this task works correctly. Are you sure?" Options: **Skip tests** / **Run tests anyway** / **Discuss**. For beginners: "I'd normally check that what I built works correctly. Do you want me to skip that check? I don't recommend it."
2. If confirmed: record a DEC- artefact in the decision journal with rationale; write `test_evidence.status: skipped` on the TASK; health score `test_pass_rate` receives a penalty for the skipped task.
3. In `supervised` mode: require **double confirmation** ("This is unusual — please confirm again").
4. **Do not invoke** the canonical run.

**Pre-condition B — no tests exist** and the artefact type warrants testing. Read `profile.yaml → dimensions.it_expertise`:
- **beginner**: Auto-generate tests, inform user ("I've created tests for this task.")
- **intermediate**: Propose ("This task should have tests. Shall I generate them?")
- **expert**: Propose with options ("No tests found. Options: generate unit tests / generate integration tests / skip / discuss")

After generation (if any), proceed to the canonical run.

**Run** — invoke the canonical test run (spec §6.3). All outputs (TCP-NNN campaign, test_evidence update, inline summary, health refresh) are produced by that procedure.

**Post-condition — failure handling:** if the canonical run ends with `test_evidence.status: fail`, present a Gate decision:
- **Fix** — attempt to fix the failing tests, then re-invoke the canonical run (default)
- **Skip** — leave `status: fail`, continue; flagged as HIGH in the next review
- **Discuss** — explore the failure with the user

### Step 4.5 — Scope Reconciliation (Creator-Activity Closure, spec P6)

After the canonical test run succeeds and before Finalize, compare what was delivered to what was planned. Deterministic, based on version-control history.

**Precondition:** `status.yaml → activity_start_sha` was recorded in Step 2. If missing (Micro mode, `git.strategy: none` with empty history, or session interrupted), skip this step with an Inform note: *"Scope Reconciliation skipped: no git baseline recorded."*

1. **Enumerate file changes:**
   ```bash
   git diff --name-status {activity_start_sha}..HEAD
   ```
   Categorize each entry: `A` (added), `M` (modified), `D` (deleted), `R` (renamed).

2. **Extract per-commit traces:**
   ```bash
   git log {activity_start_sha}..HEAD --pretty=format:"%H%n%B%n---"
   ```
   For each commit, parse the `Traces:` trailer line.

3. **Load planned scope:** read `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/reqs.md` (list of REQ-NNN) and `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/design.md` (list of DEC-NNN/DES-NNN). Build `planned_ids = {REQ-001, REQ-002, DES-001, ...}`. If either artefact is absent (Lightweight mode, early sprint), skip reconciliation with an Inform note and proceed to Step 5.

4. **Categorize each delta:**
   - **ADDED out of scope** — file status `A` AND no commit touching it has `Traces:` listing any ID in `planned_ids`.
   - **MODIFIED beyond plan** — file status `M` AND commits touching it introduce `Traces:` IDs outside `planned_ids`.
   - **OMITTED** — ID in `planned_ids` with zero commits referencing it in `Traces:`.
   - **aligned** — all other cases (silent).

5. **If all deltas are `aligned`:** skip the Gate entirely, proceed silently to Step 5.

6. **If any non-aligned delta exists, present the Scope Reconciliation table and Gate:**

   ```
   **Scope Reconciliation for TASK-{ID}:**

   | Planned | Delivered | Delta |
   |---|---|---|
   | REQ-001 add expense form | `src/forms/Expense.tsx` | aligned |
   | (nothing planned) | `db/columns/note.sql` | **ADDED out of scope** |
   | REQ-005 export CSV | — | **OMITTED** |

   **Question:** I delivered N items not in the approved plan, and M planned items are missing. How should we reconcile?

   **Options:**
   1. **Accept as deliberate** (default) — Record the N additions as a single grouped DEC-NNN, move the M OMITTED items to the backlog pool.
   2. **Revert out-of-scope** — Undo each ADDED item.
   3. **Amend requirements/design** — Append lightweight REQ-NNN / DEC-NNN to the sprint artefact to recognize emergent scope (no re-elicitation).
   4. **Discuss** — Per-delta mixed decisions.
   ```

7. **Execute the chosen option** per the spec P6 mechanics (see design doc for the concrete formats). Option 1 is the default.

8. **Clear `activity_start_sha` to empty string** after reconciliation completes.

### Step 5 — Finalize

1. Ensure all changes are committed (no uncommitted work in worktree)
2. Update TASK in `backlog.yaml`:
   - `status: review` (TASK is produced and ready to be reviewed by `/gse:review`; the terminal `done`/`reviewed` statuses are set later by REVIEW or FIX per spec §12.3 Status lifecycle)
   - `completed_at: {timestamp}`
   - `git.uncommitted_changes: 0`
3. Update `status.yaml` **activity-local state only**:
   - `last_task: TASK-{ID}` (PRODUCE-specific cursor — the current task being produced)
   - Cursor fields (`last_activity`, `last_activity_timestamp`) are set centrally by the orchestrator after the activity closes — see `agents/gse-orchestrator.md` — section "Sprint Plan Maintenance", and `gse-one-implementation-design.md` §10.1 — Sprint Plan Lifecycle.
4. Update complexity budget: subtract task complexity from sprint remaining budget
5. **Beginner auto-execution** — For beginner users, do NOT list commands for the user to run (`npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm test`, `pip install`, etc.). Instead, **execute them automatically** and report the result in plain language. Say "I'm starting the application for you" instead of "Run `npm run dev`". The beginner should never need to type a terminal command. If a command requires user interaction (e.g., opening a URL in a browser), give clear instructions: "Open this link in your browser: http://localhost:5173".
6. **Manual testing procedure** — After each completed task, provide the user with a step-by-step procedure to manually verify the result. Adapt to the project type: for web apps, the URL and actions to perform in the browser; for APIs, the curl commands or test tool instructions; for CLIs, the commands to run with expected output; for libraries, a usage example. For beginners, write the procedure in simple language with numbered steps. For experts, a concise summary is sufficient. The goal is to enable the user to validate the produced work themselves — complementing automated tests with human verification.
7. Report production summary:
   - What was produced (in beginner terms: feature descriptions, not file paths)
   - Test Campaign Summary (already shown inline during Step 4 — reiterate at summary time)
   - Manual testing procedure (from Step 6)
   - Remaining sprint budget (for intermediate/expert; hidden for beginner)
   - Next task suggestion (if any)

### Step 5.5 — Inform-Tier Decisions Summary (Creator-Activity Closure, spec P16)

Close the activity with a retrospective list of the **Inform-tier decisions** made during production (per P7 risk classification). These are the small autonomous choices the agent made without an interruptive Gate — library micro-choices, folder naming, utility-vs-framework, convention-over-configuration defaults.

1. **Assemble the list** from the agent's conversation memory for this activity. Examples: *"chose `crypto.randomUUID()` over the uuid package"*, *"folder `src/components/` over `src/ui/`"*, *"integer cents over float euros for money"*, *"HashRouter over BrowserRouter"*.

2. **If the list is empty** (rare — all choices were Gated), display explicitly: *"No inform-tier decisions made this activity — all choices were Gated."* Then proceed to Step 6 (dashboard regen).

3. **If the list is non-empty, present it and the Gate:**

   ```
   **Inform-tier decisions made during this production:**
   - {decision 1}
   - {decision 2}
   - ...

   Any of these you want to promote to a Gate decision (revisit, replace, or document as a DEC-NNN)?

   **Options:**
   1. **Accept all as-is** (default) — Record as an `## Inform-tier Decisions` section in the produce report (commit message body) and in `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/produce-{TASK-ID}.md` if such artefact exists.
   2. **Promote one or more to Gate** — For each selected decision, walk through a standard Gate (Question / Context / Options with consequence horizons / Discuss). If the user picks an alternative, the agent rolls back the inform-tier choice and applies the new one. The resulting DEC-NNN is added to `decisions.md`.
   3. **Discuss** — Explore any of the decisions before accepting or promoting.
   ```

4. Execute the chosen option. Accepted decisions are serialized as a markdown list.

### Step 6 — Regenerate Dashboard

**Regenerate dashboard** — Run `python3 "$(cat ~/.gse-one)/tools/dashboard.py"` to update `docs/dashboard.html` with the final task status (done) and budget consumption. Note: the dashboard was already refreshed right after the test run (step 7 of the canonical run); this second regen captures the TASK status transition.
