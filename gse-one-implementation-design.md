# GSE-One — Implementation Design Document

**Input:** `gse-one-spec.md`, implementation inspection and restructuration pass

---

## 2. Plugin System Comparison

All three supported environments support git operations:
- Claude Code: via `Bash` tool (git commands) and `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` tools
- Cursor: via terminal commands and Composer agent (multi-file editing in worktree context)
- opencode: via `bash` tool (git commands) and native TS plugin hooks (`tool.execute.before/after`)

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Repository Structure

> **Terminology mapping:** The directory structure maps to the concepts defined in the specification: `activities/` contains the 23 activity definitions (spec), each generated as a skill (`plugin/skills/`). `agents/` provides agent roles (spec). `templates/` provides templates. `hooks/` provides system hooks (spec P13).

```

### 3.2 Plugin Manifests

Both platforms use separate manifests with slightly different fields. The `repository` field is the **source of truth** for methodology feedback (COMPOUND Axe 2) — the agent reads this URL to create issues on the GSE-One repo. It is NOT configured in the user's `.gse/config.yaml`.

**Claude Code manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`):

```json
{
  "name": "gse",
  "description": "GSE-One — AI engineering companion for structured SDLC management. 23 commands, adaptive risk analysis, unified backlog, knowledge transfer, worktree isolation.",
  "version": "0.16.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "GSE-One Project"
  },
  "repository": "https://github.com/gse-one/gse-one",
  "skills": "./skills/",
  "agents": "./agents/",
  "hooks": "./hooks/hooks.claude.json"
}
```

**Cursor manifest** (`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`):

```json
{
  "name": "gse",
  "displayName": "GSE-One",
  "description": "GSE-One — AI engineering companion for structured SDLC management. 23 commands, adaptive risk analysis, unified backlog, knowledge transfer, worktree isolation.",
  "version": "0.16.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "GSE-One Project"
  },
  "repository": "https://github.com/gse-one/gse-one",
  "skills": "./skills/",
  "agents": "./agents/",
  "rules": "./rules/",
  "hooks": "./hooks/hooks.cursor.json"
}
```

Key differences:
- Claude uses `hooks` pointing to `hooks.claude.json`; Cursor uses `hooks` pointing to `hooks.cursor.json`
- Cursor has `displayName` and `rules` fields; Claude does not
- Claude loads methodology via `settings.json` → agent reference; Cursor loads via `rules/`

### 3.3 Mono-Plugin Architecture

ONE directory (`plugin/`) serves both platforms. Shared components — skills, agents, and templates — exist once. Platform-specific files are minimal:

| File | Claude Code | Cursor | Purpose |
|------|:-----------:|:------:|---------|
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | **used** | ignored | Claude manifest |
| `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | ignored | **used** | Cursor manifest |
| `settings.json` | **used** | ignored | Agent identity reference |
| `hooks/hooks.claude.json` | **used** | ignored | Claude hook format (PascalCase) |
| `hooks/hooks.cursor.json` | ignored | **used** | Cursor hook format (camelCase) |
| `rules/gse-orchestrator.mdc` | ignored | **used** | Cursor always-on methodology rule |
| `skills/` (23) | **shared** | **shared** | All activity skills |
| `agents/` (9 in source, 8 for Cursor) | **shared** (9: 8 specialized + orchestrator) | **shared** (8: specialized only) | Agent roles for sub-agent delegation |
| `templates/` (15) | **shared** | **shared** | All artefact/config templates |

Claude ignores the `rules/` directory silently. Cursor ignores `settings.json` silently. The orchestrator agent (`agents/gse-orchestrator.md`) exists in the source `plugin/` directory for Claude Code, but the installer **excludes it from Cursor** installations — Cursor loads the orchestrator identity via `rules/gse-orchestrator.mdc` instead, avoiding double-loading of the same ~400-line content.

## 4. Git-Integrated Skill Designs

> **Terminology:** This document describes the design of **skills** — the technical artifacts (`SKILL.md` files in `plugin/skills/`) that deliver the **activities** defined in the specification. Each skill implements exactly one activity: the skill `plan/SKILL.md` delivers the activity `/gse:plan`. See the specification for the formal relationship between activities, skills, commands, and inclusion policies.

> **Note:** This document details the 17 skills that required specific design decisions (git integration, new mechanisms, complex workflows). The following 5 activities are implemented directly from the spec without additional design: `/gse:reqs`, `/gse:design`, `/gse:preview`, `/gse:compound`, `/gse:integrate`. See the specification for their full definitions.

> **Spec-driven enrichments:** The following features are implemented in skills and principles directly from the specification, without additional design. See the specification for details: three-level language management (chat/artifacts/overrides) in HUG and P9; output formatting rules and emoji control in P9; recovery check for unsaved work in `/gse:go`; intent-first mode for beginner users in `/gse:go`; progressive expertise tracking by domain in P9 and the user profile; Hetzner deployment skill (`/gse:deploy`) with flexible starting points (solo full-flow, pre-configured server, training mode with shared Coolify); conversational elicitation and ISO 25010 quality checklist in `/gse:reqs`.

### 4.1 `/gse:plan` — Git Integration

**Added to the plan skill workflow** (writes branch assignments to `.gse/plan.yaml` and `.gse/backlog.yaml`):

```markdown
### Git Step (Step 6 — Git Integration, between Step 5 "Promote to Sprint" and Step 7 "Persist Plan")

Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `git.strategy`.

**If strategy is `worktree` or `branch-only`:**

0. **Precondition — git baseline exists:**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --verify main
   ```
   If this fails → **Hard guardrail**: "`main` has no commits. Run `/gse:hug` to initialize the repository with a foundational commit before planning."

1. Check if sprint branch exists:
   ```bash
   git branch --list "gse/sprint-<N>/integration"
   ```

2. If strategic plan and no sprint integration branch:
   - Create sprint integration branch from main:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b gse/sprint-<N>/integration main
     git checkout main  # return to main
     ```
   - If strategy is `worktree`, create sprint worktree:
     ```bash
     git worktree add .worktrees/sprint-<N> gse/sprint-<N>/integration
     ```

3. For each planned task, assign a branch name:
   - Format: `gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<short-description>`
   - Type is derived from task artefact type: requirement/design → `docs/`,
     code → `feat/`, test → `test/`, fix → `fix/`
   - Record branch name in `.gse/plan.yaml` (`tasks[].branch`) and in `.gse/backlog.yaml` for each task

4. Update each TASK entry in `.gse/backlog.yaml` with `git.branch` (planned, not yet created) and `git.branch_status: planned`.

**If strategy is `none`:** Skip all git operations.
```

### 4.2 `/gse:produce` — Git Integration

**Added to the produce skill workflow** (reads branch name from `.gse/plan.yaml` tasks or `.gse/backlog.yaml` git state):

```markdown
### Git Step (before production begins)

Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `git.strategy`.

**If strategy is `worktree`:**

1. Get the planned branch name from `.gse/plan.yaml` (`tasks[].branch`) or `.gse/backlog.yaml` (`git.branch`) for this task.

2. Create the feature branch from the sprint branch:
   ```bash
   git branch gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<name> gse/sprint-<N>/integration
   ```

3. Create a worktree for this branch:
   ```bash
   git worktree add .worktrees/sprint-<N>-<type>-<name> gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<name>
   ```

4. Update the TASK entry in `.gse/backlog.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   - id: TASK-<ID>
     status: in-progress
     git:
       branch: gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<name>
       branch_status: active
       worktree: .worktrees/sprint-<N>-<type>-<name>
       worktree_status: active
       commits: 0
       uncommitted_changes: 0
   ```

5. All subsequent file operations for this task happen inside the worktree directory.
   The agent must use the worktree path as the working directory.

**If strategy is `branch-only`:**

1. Create feature branch and switch to it:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<name> gse/sprint-<N>/integration
   ```

2. All work happens on this branch. Switch back to integration branch when done.

**If strategy is `none`:** Work directly on current branch.

### Commit Convention

During production, commit frequently using the convention:

```
gse(sprint-<N>/<type>): <description>

Sprint: <N>
Traces: <artefact IDs>
```

Commit at logical checkpoints:
- After each file is complete
- After each test passes
- Before switching to a different sub-task
```

### 4.3 `/gse:review` — Git Integration

**Added to the review skill workflow:**

```markdown
### Git Step (at review start)

Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `git.strategy`.

**If strategy is `worktree` or `branch-only`:**

1. Identify the branch to review (from plan or user argument).

2. Generate the diff against the sprint branch:
   ```bash
   git diff gse/sprint-<N>/integration...gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<name> --stat
   git diff gse/sprint-<N>/integration...gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<name>
   ```

3. The review operates on this **diff**, not on the full file state.
   This means reviewers see exactly what changed, making the review
   more focused and efficient.

4. If the worktree exists, read files from the worktree path.
   If not (branch-only), read files from the branch:
   ```bash
   git show gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<name>:<filepath>
   ```

5. Review findings reference both the file path and the branch:
   ```
   RVW-005 [HIGH] — Missing input validation
     Location: gse/sprint-03/feat/user-auth:src/auth.py:42
     ...
   ```

**If strategy is `none`:** Review files in-place as before.
```

### 4.4 `/gse:fix` — Git Integration

**Added to the fix skill workflow:**

```markdown
### Git Step (before applying fixes)

Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `git.strategy`.

**If strategy is `worktree`:**

1. Create a fix branch from the reviewed feature branch:
   ```bash
   git branch gse/sprint-<N>/fix/rvw-<ID> gse/sprint-<N>/<type>/<name>
   ```

2. Create a worktree for the fix:
   ```bash
   git worktree add .worktrees/sprint-<N>-fix-rvw-<ID> gse/sprint-<N>/fix/rvw-<ID>
   ```

3. Apply fixes in the fix worktree.

4. After fixes are complete and verified:
   - Merge fix branch back into the feature branch (fast-forward if possible)
   - Delete fix worktree and branch
   - Update TASK in backlog.yaml: `status: done`, `git.branch_status: active` (ready to merge)

**If strategy is `branch-only`:**

1. Create fix branch, switch to it, apply fixes, merge back.

**If strategy is `none`:** Apply fixes in-place.
```

### 4.5 `/gse:deliver` — Git Integration

**This is the most git-heavy skill. Full workflow:**

```markdown
### Delivery Workflow

Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `git.strategy`.

**If strategy is `none`:**
- Generate changelog from `.gse/decisions.md` and sprint artefacts
- Tag current state (if git repo exists): `git tag v<version>`
- Done

**If strategy is `worktree` or `branch-only`:**

#### Step 1 — Pre-flight Check

1. Verify all feature branches have been reviewed:
   ```bash
   # Check backlog.yaml — all sprint TASKs should have status: done
   ```
   If any are `active` or `paused` → **Hard guardrail**: "These branches
   have not been reviewed: [list]. Review them first or exclude from delivery."

2. Check for merge conflicts between feature branches and sprint branch:
   ```bash
   git merge-tree $(git merge-base gse/sprint-<N>/integration gse/sprint-<N>/feat/X) \
     gse/sprint-<N>/integration gse/sprint-<N>/feat/X
   ```
   If conflicts → **Gate**: present conflicts, options to resolve.

3. Check for uncommitted changes in worktrees:
   If any → **Hard guardrail**: "Commit or discard changes first."

#### Step 2 — Merge Feature Branches into Sprint Branch

For each feature branch in the merge queue (ordered by dependency):

1. **Gate decision** — merge strategy:
   Present the structured interaction pattern with squash/merge/rebase options
   (see spec Section 10.4). Default proposal from `git.merge_strategy_default`.

2. Execute the chosen merge:
   ```bash
   # Example: squash merge
   git checkout gse/sprint-<N>/integration
   git merge --squash gse/sprint-<N>/feat/<name>
   git commit -m "gse(sprint-<N>/deliver): merge feat/<name> (squash)

   Sprint: <N>
   Traces: TASK-<ID>, [artefact IDs]"
   ```

3. Repeat for each feature branch.

#### Step 3 — Merge Sprint Branch into Main

1. **Gate decision** — merge sprint into main:
   ```
   **Question:** Merge sprint <N> into main?
   
   **Context:** Sprint branch has <M> merged features, 
     all reviewed, no conflicts with main.
   
   **Options:**
   1. Merge — create a merge commit on main
   2. Squash — all sprint work becomes one commit on main
   3. Defer — keep sprint branch, don't merge yet
   4. Discuss
   ```

2. Execute merge:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge gse/sprint-<N>/integration --no-ff \
     -m "gse(deliver): sprint <N> — <summary>

   Sprint: <N>"
   ```

#### Step 4 — Tag Release

If `git.tag_on_deliver` is true:
```bash
git tag -a v<version> -m "Release v<version> — Sprint <N>"
```

Version is determined by:
- Read current latest tag
- Increment based on sprint content (major/minor/patch — Gate decision if ambiguous)

#### Step 5 — Cleanup

If `git.cleanup_on_deliver` is true:
1. Delete merged feature branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -d gse/sprint-<N>/feat/<name>
   ```
2. Remove worktree directories:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove .worktrees/sprint-<N>-feat-<name>
   ```
3. Optionally delete sprint branch (Gate — user may want to keep for history).
4. Update each delivered TASK in `.gse/backlog.yaml`: `status: delivered`, `git.branch_status: deleted`, `git.worktree_status: removed`.

#### Step 6 — Generate Release Notes

Create `docs/sprints/sprint-<N>/release.md`:
- Features delivered (from plan)
- Review findings resolved
- Decisions made (from journal)
- Health score at delivery
- Git tag and commit hash

Report:
```
Delivered: Sprint <N> — v<version>
  Features merged: X
  Review findings resolved: Y
  Tag: v<version> (commit <hash>)
  Health at delivery: Z/10
```
```

### 4.6 `/gse:pause` — Git Integration

```markdown
### Git Step (before checkpoint save)

Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `git.auto_commit_on_pause`.

If true:
1. For each active TASK in `.gse/backlog.yaml` (where `git.worktree_status: active`):
   ```bash
   cd <worktree-path>
   git add -A
   git status --short
   # If there are changes:
   git commit -m "gse(pause): checkpoint — work in progress

   Sprint: <N>
   Task: TASK-<ID>"
   ```

2. Update each TASK in backlog: set `git.uncommitted_changes: 0`.

3. Include worktree state in checkpoint:
   ```yaml
   # checkpoint-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.yaml
   ...
   git:
     current_branch: gse/sprint-03/feat/user-auth
     worktrees: <extracted from backlog.yaml TASK git states>
     last_commit_per_worktree:
       sprint-03-feat-user-auth: <commit-hash>
       sprint-03-feat-dashboard: <commit-hash>
   ```
```

### 4.7 `/gse:resume` — Git Integration

```markdown
### Git Step (after checkpoint load)

1. Verify all worktrees from the checkpoint still exist:
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```

2. For each expected worktree:
   - If present: check for external changes since checkpoint
     ```bash
     cd <worktree-path>
     git log <saved-hash>..HEAD --oneline
     ```
     If new commits exist: "This worktree was modified since your last session.
     N new commits found. Review them?"
   
   - If missing: "Worktree <name> is missing. Recreate it?"
     If yes: `git worktree add <path> <branch>`

3. Report worktree state:
   ```
   Worktrees restored:
     ✓ sprint-03-feat-user-auth — active, no external changes
     ✓ sprint-03-feat-dashboard — paused, 2 external commits detected
     ✗ sprint-03-fix-rvw-005 — missing (branch exists, worktree deleted)
   ```

4. Propose next action based on where work stopped.
```

### 4.8 `/gse:status` — Git Extension

```markdown
### Git Status Section

Add to status output:

```
Git:
  Current branch: gse/sprint-03/feat/user-auth
  Sprint branch:  gse/sprint-03/integration

  Active worktrees:
    ✓ sprint-03-feat-user-auth    active    0 uncommitted   TASK-003
    ◉ sprint-03-feat-dashboard    paused    3 uncommitted   TASK-005
    ★ sprint-03-fix-rvw-005       ready     0 uncommitted   TASK-008

  Merge queue:
    gse/sprint-03/feat/login     reviewed  no conflicts    ready

  Stale branches: none
  Main status: clean, tagged v0.2.1
```

Flags:
  --branches    Show all gse/* branches
  --decisions   Show auto-decision log
  --worktrees   Show detailed worktree info
```

### 4.9 `/gse:health` — Git Hygiene Sub-Score

```markdown
### Git Hygiene Computation

Score 0–10 based on:

| Factor | Weight | Score 10 | Score 0 |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| Active branches | 20% | ≤3 | >10 |
| Stale branches | 20% | 0 | >3 |
| Uncommitted changes | 20% | 0 across all worktrees | >5 files |
| Merge conflicts | 20% | 0 | >0 |
| Main branch clean | 10% | Clean + tagged | Dirty |
| Unreviewed branches | 10% | 0 | >2 |

Report as one of 8 dimensions in health dashboard:
```
  Git hygiene:             █████░░░░░  3 branches, 1 stale      (5/10)
```

Git-specific alerts:
```
  ⚠ GIT: 2 worktrees have uncommitted changes
  ⚠ GIT: Branch gse/sprint-02/feat/old not touched in 12 days
  ✓ GIT: No merge conflicts detected
  ✓ GIT: main is clean and tagged (v0.2.1)
```

## 5. Skill Designs

### 5.1 `/gse:learn` — Knowledge Transfer Skill

```markdown
# skills/learn/SKILL.md
---
description: "Start or continue a learning session. Triggered when the user asks to learn, understand, or be taught a concept. Also triggered proactively by the agent at natural workflow transition points when a competency gap is detected. Covers: /gse:learn <topic>, /gse:learn --notes, /gse:learn --roadmap."
---

# GSE-One Learn — Knowledge Transfer

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Options

- `<topic>` — Start a reactive learning session on the given topic
- `--notes` — List all learning notes by topic
- `--notes <topic>` — Show the learning note on a specific topic
- `--notes --recent` — Show notes from the current sprint
- `--roadmap` — Show the competency map: learned, gaps, recommendations
- `--quick` — Force quick mode (5 min)
- `--deep` — Force deep mode (15 min)
- `--help` — Show learning help

## Prerequisites

1. Read `.gse/profile.yaml` → competency_map section
2. Read `.gse/profile.yaml` → user.language, user.it_expertise, user.domain_background
3. If `--notes`, read `docs/learning/` directory listing

## Workflow

### If `--notes` or `--roadmap`
Consultation mode — read and display, no session.

### If reactive (user provides topic)

1. Check if a learning note exists for this topic in `docs/learning/`
2. If exists: offer to review/extend. If not: create new.
3. Determine mode: `--quick` or `--deep` or auto-detect from topic complexity
4. Generate the session content calibrated to user level (P9):
   - Key concepts explained with analogies from user's domain_background
   - Application to the user's actual project (reference real files, branches, artefacts)
   - Practice exercise (deep mode only) — a small task in the project context
   - Quick reference card at the end
5. Save/update learning note in `docs/learning/<topic-slug>.md`
6. Update competency_map in profile

### If proactive (agent-initiated)

This is triggered by other skills (go, compound, plan, review) at transition points.
The learn skill receives the topic and trigger context.

1. Present using the structured interaction pattern:
   ```
   **Learning opportunity:** <topic>
   **Context:** <why this matters now>
   **Options:**
   1. Quick overview (5 min)
   2. Deeper session (15 min)
   3. Not now — remind me next sprint
   4. Not interested in this topic
   ```
2. If accepted: run the reactive workflow above
3. If "not now": record in profile as deferred
4. If "not interested": record in profile as declined (never propose again)

## Contextual Tips (cross-cutting)

Not part of the learn skill itself, but embedded in the `settings.json` agent key
(Claude Code) or the identity rule (Cursor). Logic:

1. After any action where a technical concept was involved:
   - Check competency_map: has this concept been explained?
   - If not, and the concept is relevant: insert 2-3 sentence explanation
   - Mark concept as explained in competency_map
2. Aggregate contextual tips into a learning note at sprint end (during /gse:compound)
```

### 5.2 `/gse:backlog` — Unified Work Item Management (NEW)

```markdown
# skills/backlog/SKILL.md
---
description: "View and manage the project backlog — the unified list of all work items (TASK). Filter by sprint, pool, or artefact type. Add items manually. Sync with GitHub Issues. Triggered when user asks about tasks, backlog, work items, what's left to do, or issue management."
---

# GSE-One Backlog — Unified Work Item Management

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Sub-commands

- (no args) — Show full backlog (pool + current sprint)
- `add <description>` — Add a new item to the pool
- `sprint` — Show current sprint items only
- `pool` — Show unplanned items only
- `--type <type>` — Filter by artefact_type (code/test/requirement/design/doc/config/import)
- `sync` — Synchronize with GitHub Issues
- `--help` — Show backlog help

## Prerequisites

1. Read `.gse/backlog.yaml`
2. Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `github` section
3. Read `.gse/status.yaml` → current sprint number

## Workflow

### Display mode (no args, sprint, pool, --type)

1. Read backlog items
2. Filter by requested view
3. Present grouped by sprint assignment:
   ```
   Sprint 3 (current):
     ● TASK-038  code   Implement auth        in-progress  branch: active
     ● TASK-039  test   Auth unit tests       done         branch: active (ready to merge)
     ○ TASK-040  design API architecture      planned      branch: planned

   Pool (unplanned):
     ○ TASK-042  code   Add dark mode         open
     ○ TASK-047  req    Payment NFR           open
   ```

4. If `--type` filter: show only matching artefact_type

### Add mode

1. Create a new TASK with auto-incremented ID
2. Ask for artefact_type if not obvious from description (Inform tier)
3. Set sprint: null, status: open
4. If github.enabled: create GitHub Issue and record number
5. Append to `.gse/backlog.yaml`

### Sync mode

1. Read `.gse/config.yaml` → github settings
2. If not enabled: "GitHub sync is not configured. Enable it?" (Gate)
3. If enabled:
   - Pull: fetch open issues not in backlog → create TASK entries
   - Push: create issues for local items without github_issue
   - Update: sync status changes bidirectionally
   - Report: "Synced: N new from GitHub, M pushed to GitHub, K status updates"

## Auto-creation by other skills

The backlog skill is also called internally by:
- REVIEW: creates TASK for findings that need future work
- PLAN: creates TASK for newly planned items
- COLLECT: creates TASK for imported GitHub Issues
- DELIVER: closes TASK (status: delivered), auto-closes GitHub Issues

These internal calls don't show the backlog display — they just modify backlog.yaml.
```

### 5.3 `/gse:collect` — External Source Mode Extension

```markdown
### External Source Workflow (added to collect skill)

Triggered when $ARGUMENTS contains paths or URLs.

1. Parse arguments: separate local paths from URLs
2. For each local path:
   - Verify it exists
   - Scan recursively for source files, tests, docs, configs
   - Detect language/framework from file extensions and package manifests
3. For each URL (GitHub):
   - Use `gh api` or `git clone --depth 1` to shallow-clone
   - Read README, package manifest, directory structure
   - Detect license
4. For each discovered element, compute reusability assessment:
   - Compare language/framework with current project (from `.gse/config.yaml`)
   - Check dependency compatibility
   - Estimate integration cost in complexity points
   - Classify: reusable as-is / adaptable / incompatible
5. Present as Gate decision (one choice per element: Include / Skip / Discuss)
6. Save all results to `.gse/sources.yaml` (retained + skipped)
7. For retained elements: prepare import/adapt task entries for PLAN

### Provenance in produced artefacts

When PRODUCE executes an import task, it must add provenance fields:
```yaml
gse:
  source: SRC-001
  source_origin: ~/other-project/src/auth.py
  adaptation: "Replaced Flask with FastAPI"
```
```

### 5.4 `/gse:go` — Adopt Mode

```markdown
### Adopt Mode (added to go skill)

Triggered when:
- `.gse/` does not exist AND the project has existing files (>0 source files)
- OR user passes `--adopt`

Workflow:

1. **Detect** — "This project has existing code but no GSE-One state.
   Would you like to onboard it?" (Inform tier — can skip)

2. **Scan** — Run `/gse:collect` (internal mode) to inventory artefacts

3. **Infer state**:
   - Read git log: count commits, identify tags, detect branch patterns
   - Estimate "sprint 0" baseline: current main HEAD is the starting point
   - Detect project domain from package manifests / file extensions

4. **Initialize `.gse/`**:
   - Create config.yaml with inferred domain and git strategy
   - Create profile.yaml (trigger HUG interview)
   - Create status.yaml with sprint: 0, phase: LC01

5. **Propose annotation** (Gate):
   "I found N existing artefacts. Add GSE-One traceability metadata?"
   - Option 1: Yes, annotate all (add frontmatter to existing .md files)
   - Option 2: Annotate new artefacts only (leave existing files untouched)
   - Option 3: Skip annotation entirely

6. **Transition** — proceed to normal LC01 for sprint 1
```

### 5.5 Lightweight Mode (Go Skill Extension)

```markdown
### Mode Selection (Complexity Assessment — added to go skill)

At start of /gse:go, when no sprint is defined:

1. If `.gse/config.yaml` exists with `lifecycle.mode` → use stored mode
2. Otherwise → run complexity assessment:
   - Scan 7 structural complexity signals: dependencies (manifest), persistence (ORM/SQL/DB config), entry points, multi-component, tests, CI/CD, git maturity
   - Apply rules: no manifest + no git + ≤2 source files (trivialiy pre-filter) → Micro; persistence/multi-component/CI/deps>10/entry>10 → Full; otherwise → Lightweight
   - Present as Gate decision with rationale
   - Store chosen mode in `config.yaml → lifecycle.mode`

3. If beginner + first sprint → Intent-First mode runs BEFORE complexity assessment (captures intent, then assesses)

Three project modes based on complexity assessment:

| Mode | Selection | Lifecycle | Git | Health | REQS | TESTS |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| **Micro** | Trivial (script, no manifest) | PRODUCE → DELIVER | direct commit | none | Not enforced | Not enforced |
| **Lightweight** | Simple (few deps, no persistence) | PLAN → REQS → PRODUCE → DELIVER | branch-only | 3 dims | Hard (reduced ceremony) | Soft (auto-generated) |
| **Full** | Complex (persistence, multi-component, CI) | LC01 → LC02 → LC03 | worktree | 8 dims | Hard (full ceremony) | Hard (formal strategy) |

Micro mode: 1 state file only (`.gse/status.yaml` with inline profile + task list).
No REQS/TESTS guardrails. No health. No complexity budget.

User can upgrade Micro → Lightweight → Full anytime via `/gse:go`.
```

### 5.6 Team Profile Detection (HUG Skill Extension)

```markdown
### Team Mode (added to hug skill)

At start of /gse:hug:

1. Detect current git user: `git config user.name`
2. Check if `.gse/profiles/` directory exists
3. If team mode (multiple profiles):
   - Look for `.gse/profiles/<username>.yaml`
   - If found: load and offer to update
   - If not found: create new profile via interview
   - Symlink `.gse/profile.yaml` → `.gse/profiles/<username>.yaml`
4. If solo mode (no profiles/ directory):
   - Use `.gse/profile.yaml` directly (current behavior)
   - If user answers "team" to team_context question → create profiles/ directory
     and move profile.yaml into it
```

### 5.7 Merge Strategy Expertise Adaptation (Deliver Skill Extension)

```markdown
### Adaptive Merge Presentation (added to deliver skill)

At merge Gate decision, read user profile → it_expertise:

**Beginner:**
- Hide git terminology (squash, merge, rebase)
- Present as: "Clean summary" vs "Full history" vs "Let me decide"
- Agent recommends one option
- Map user's choice to git command silently

**Intermediate:**
- Plain-language + technical term in parentheses
- "Clean summary (squash merge)" / "Full history (merge commit)" / "Linear (rebase)"

**Expert:**
- Direct technical options with consequence horizons
- squash / merge / rebase with pros/cons
```

### 5.8 Non-Code Health Dimensions (Health Skill Extension)

```markdown
### Configurable Dimensions (added to health skill)

Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `health.disabled_dimensions`

If dimensions are disabled:
- Exclude from score computation
- Exclude from dashboard display
- Adjust score denominator (e.g., 5 active dimensions → score out of 5, normalized to 10)

Default enabled:
- requirements_coverage
- test_pass_rate
- design_debt
- review_findings
- complexity_budget
- traceability
- git_hygiene
- ai_integrity
```

### 5.9 `/gse:tests` — Testing Strategy Skill (Extended)

```markdown
# skills/tests/SKILL.md
---
description: "Define test strategy, set up test environment, write tests, execute campaigns, and produce evidence. Triggered when the user asks about testing, wants to add tests, or when /gse:produce needs to run tests after code production. Covers unit, integration, E2E, visual, and acceptance tests."
---

# GSE-One Tests — Full Testing Lifecycle

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Options

- `--strategy` — Define/update the test strategy (pyramid, coverage targets)
- `--setup` — Install and configure test environment (frameworks, browsers)
- `--run` — Execute all tests and produce campaign report
- `--run <test-id>` — Execute a specific test
- `--visual` — Run visual tests only (screenshots + analysis)
- `--coverage` — Show coverage report
- `--evidence` — Browse test evidence (screenshots, videos)
- `--help` — Show testing help

## Prerequisites

1. Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `testing` section
2. Read `.gse/config.yaml` → `project.domain` (for pyramid calibration)
3. Read `.gse/profile.yaml` → `user.it_expertise` (for interaction depth)
4. Read latest `docs/sprints/sprint-NN/test-strategy.md` if exists

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Strategy (if --strategy or first time)

1. Detect project domain from config
2. Propose test pyramid calibrated to domain (see spec Section 6.1):
   - Web frontend: 20% unit, 20% integration, 30% E2E/visual, 20% acceptance, 10% other
   - API backend: 50% unit, 25% integration, 5% E2E, 10% acceptance, 10% other
   - etc.
3. Present as Inform (expert) or Gate (beginner) decision
4. For web/mobile projects, propose visual testing setup (Gate)
5. Save strategy in `docs/sprints/sprint-NN/test-strategy.md`
6. **Conditional strategy review** (spec §6.5 — STRATEGY tier) — Runs when `project.domain` is security-sensitive OR `complexity_budget > 15` OR the flag `--review-strategy` / `--deep-review` was passed. Spawns the `test-strategist` sub-agent with the "Strategy checklist" scope. Findings `[STRATEGY]` append to `review.md`. HIGH blocks `/gse:produce` via the Hard guardrail.

### Step 2 — Environment Setup (if --setup or first time)

1. Detect language/framework from package manifest
2. Select test framework:
   - Python → pytest + coverage.py
   - JS/TS → vitest or jest + c8
   - Go → go test + cover
3. Install as dev dependency (auto or with user confirmation by expertise)
4. If visual testing enabled:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
   ```
5. Create test directory structure: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`
6. Configure test runner (config file, scripts in package.json / pyproject.toml)

### Step 3 — Write Tests

For each TASK in the sprint with testing needs:
1. Read the requirements (REQ) and design (DES) traced to this TASK
2. Generate tests at the appropriate level (from strategy):
   - Unit tests for individual functions
   - Integration tests for module interactions
   - E2E tests for user workflow scenarios
   - Visual tests (if enabled): navigate pages, capture screenshots
3. Each test has a TST-NNN ID and traces to its REQ/DES
4. Adapt test complexity to user level:
   - Beginner: simple, readable tests with comments
   - Expert: property-based, edge-case-heavy tests
5. **Conditional TST specs review** (spec §6.5 — TST-SPEC tier) — Runs when ≥ 1 TST carries `quality_gap: true` OR total TST count ≥ 20 OR the flag `--review-specs` / `--deep-review` was passed. Spawns the `test-strategist` sub-agent with the "Specifications checklist" scope. Findings `[TST-SPEC]` append to `review.md`. HIGH blocks `/gse:produce`.

### Step 4 — Execute (if --run)

Invoke the **canonical test run** defined in spec §6.3. Argument handling determines scope (full suite / TST-NNN / `--level X` / visual-only). The canonical run covers: execution, evidence capture, `tests/evidence/sprint-NN/TASK-NNN/` save, TCP-NNN campaign creation, `test_evidence` write, inline chat summary, and health + dashboard refresh.

TESTS does NOT auto-generate missing tests; they must already exist. If not, redirect to `--strategy` / Step 3.

### Step 5 — Screenshot analysis

Part of the canonical run when visual testing is enabled (see spec §6.3 "Screenshot analysis").

### Step 6 — Sprint evidence aggregate (--evidence only)

Only invoked by `--evidence`. Aggregates all per-run TCPs of the current sprint into a single sprint-level campaign (also TCP-prefixed), with `traces.derives_from` pointing at the rolled-up TCPs. No test execution is performed.

### Step 7 — (removed)

Health dimensions and TASK `test_evidence` are updated automatically by the canonical run (spec §6.3 step 7 and step 5). No separate step needed here.
```

### 5.10 `/gse:produce` — Test Execution After Production

```markdown
### Test Execution (added to produce skill, after code is written)

PRODUCE invokes the **canonical test run** (spec §6.3) as its test execution phase. This section documents only the PRODUCE-specific pre/post-conditions:

**Pre-condition — `--skip-tests`:** Gate decision, DEC- logged, `test_evidence.status: skipped` on the TASK, canonical run is NOT invoked.

**Pre-condition — no tests exist:** per expertise level, auto-generate (beginner), propose (intermediate), or offer options (expert). After generation, invoke the canonical run.

**Post-condition — canonical run returns `status: fail`:** Gate decision (Fix / Skip / Discuss). Fix re-invokes the canonical run.

The canonical run produces TCP-NNN campaign, `test_evidence` update on the TASK, inline summary in chat, and health + dashboard refresh. Example of the written `test_evidence` block on the TASK:
```yaml
- id: TASK-038
  test_evidence:
    status: pass
    campaign_ref: docs/sprints/sprint-03/test-reports/campaign-2026-04-10-TASK-038.md
    timestamp: 2026-04-10T14:30:00Z
    pass_rate: 91.7
    code_coverage: 78
    summary: "24 tests, 22 passed, 2 failed"
```
```

### 5.11 `/gse:review` — Devil's Advocate Agent (P16) — `[IMPL]` Tier

```markdown
### Devil's Advocate — [IMPL] review tier (added to review skill)

After the standard quality review (the `[IMPL]` tier per spec §6.5), activate the devil-advocate agent:

1. **Scope:** Only the agent's own productions from this sprint (not user-written code)

2. **Checks:**
   a. **Hallucination hunt:**
      - For each library/dependency recommended: verify it exists
        ```bash
        pip show <lib>  # or npm list <lib>
        ```
      - For each API call: verify the endpoint/method exists in the actual docs
      - For each pattern cited: verify the source exists

   b. **Assumption challenge:**
      - List all implicit assumptions in the design
      - For each: "What if this assumption is wrong?"
      - Flag assumptions that have no supporting evidence

   c. **Complaisance detection:**
      - Review decision history: did the agent always agree with the user?
      - Were alternatives genuinely explored or dismissed quickly?
      - Were any user ideas that should have been challenged accepted without pushback?

   d. **Edge case coverage:**
      - For each function: what happens with null, empty, very large, malicious input?
      - For each API: what happens on timeout, 5xx, rate limit?

   e. **Temporal validity:**
      - Flag any recommendation based on ecosystem state that may have changed
      - Check: "Is this library still maintained? Has the API changed?"

3. **Output:** Findings tagged `[AI-INTEGRITY]` in the review report:
   ```
   RVW-012 [AI-INTEGRITY] [HIGH] — Library does not exist
     Agent recommended `fastapi-magic-auth`. Not found on PyPI.
     Fix: Replace with `fastapi-users` (verified: exists, 2.3k stars).

   RVW-013 [AI-INTEGRITY] [MEDIUM] — Unchallenged user decision
     User chose MongoDB for relational data (DEC-008). Agent agreed without
     presenting PostgreSQL as alternative. Risk: relational queries will be
     complex and slow.

   RVW-014 [AI-INTEGRITY] [LOW] — Outdated pattern
     Agent used `datetime.utcnow()` which is deprecated since Python 3.12.
     Fix: Use `datetime.now(UTC)`.
   ```

4. **Integration with P15 confidence:**
   - Findings where confidence was "Moderate" or "Low" are flagged with higher severity
   - Findings where confidence was "Verified" but verification was wrong → CRITICAL
```

### 5.12 User Pushback Detection (Cross-cutting, in settings.json)

```markdown
### Pushback Logic (embedded in settings.json agent key)

The agent tracks a `consecutive_acceptances` counter in `.gse/status.yaml`:

1. After each Gate decision:
   - If user chose the recommended option without discussion: increment counter
   - If user chose "Discuss", modified, or chose non-recommended: reset counter

2. Threshold check (calibrated by expertise):
   - Beginner: trigger at 3
   - Intermediate: trigger at 5
   - Expert: trigger at 8

3. When threshold reached:
   - Read the last N decisions from `.gse/decisions.md`
   - Select the 3 most impactful (highest risk tier)
   - Present the critical checkpoint pattern (see spec P16)

4. After checkpoint:
   - If user says "everything looks good": reset counter, don't trigger
     again until next sprint
   - If user revisits a decision: reset counter, re-enter Gate for that decision
   - If user says "overwhelmed": switch to more Gate decisions, reduce pace
```

### 5.13 `/gse:assess` — Gap Analysis Skill (NEW — G-002)

```markdown
# skills/assess/SKILL.md
---
description: "Evaluate project artefact status against goals. Identifies covered, partial, and uncovered goals. Triggered when user asks to assess, evaluate progress, or check readiness."
---

# GSE-One Assess — Gap Analysis

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Gather Inputs
1. Read artefact inventory from latest COLLECT (or run inline)
2. Read project goals from `.gse/config.yaml → project` or ask user
3. Read backlog pool for pending items

### Step 2 — Analyze Coverage
For each project goal:
- **Covered:** artefacts exist, status = approved or implemented
- **Partial:** artefacts exist, status = draft or reviewed (incomplete)
- **Uncovered:** no artefacts linked to this goal
- **At risk:** high-complexity or security-sensitive gaps

### Step 3 — External Source Assessment
If external sources were collected (`.gse/sources.yaml`):
- For each retained source: evaluate compatibility and integration cost
- Flag sources that no longer match project direction

### Step 4 — Output Gap Report
Present to user with Inform tier:
```
Gap Analysis — Sprint N

  ✓ COVERED: User auth (REQ-007) — implemented, tested
  ◐ PARTIAL: API docs (REQ-012) — design done, no implementation
  ✗ UNCOVERED: Payment processing (REQ-015) — no artefacts
  ⚠ AT RISK: Data encryption (REQ-009) — security-sensitive, no tests

  Recommendation: 2 uncovered goals should become TASK items for next sprint.
```

### Step 5 — Feed PLAN
Uncovered goals → candidate TASK items in backlog pool (auto-created with `origin: assess`)
```

### 5.14 `/gse:go` — Orchestrator Decision Logic (NEW — G-007)

```markdown
### Orchestrator Decision Tree (added to go skill)

When `/gse:go` is invoked:

**Step 1 — Detect project state:**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `.gse/` absent + project has files | Adopt mode (see 5.5) |
| `.gse/` absent + project empty | HUG (LC00) |
| `.gse/` exists | Read `status.yaml` → Step 2 |

**Step 2 — Determine next action:**

| Current state | Next action |
|--------------|-------------|
| No sprint exists | Start LC01: GO > COLLECT > ASSESS > PLAN |
| Sprint, plan not approved | Resume PLAN |
| Sprint, tasks in-progress | Resume PRODUCE on current task |
| Sprint, tasks done, not reviewed | Start REVIEW |
| Sprint, review done, HIGH/MEDIUM findings exist | Start FIX (conditionally inserted by orchestrator) |
| Sprint, review done, no HIGH/MEDIUM findings | Skip FIX → Start DELIVER |
| Sprint, all delivered | Start LC03: COMPOUND > INTEGRATE |
| Sprint, compound done | Propose next sprint → LC01 |
| Sprint stale (> `lifecycle.stale_sprint_sessions` sessions without progress) | Step 3 |

Progression is defined as any TASK status change (e.g., `planned` → `in-progress`, `in-progress` → `done`). A session where no TASK status changes counts as a session without progress, incrementing `sessions_without_progress` in `status.yaml`.

**Step 3 — Stale sprint detection (Gate):**
```
Sprint N has had X sessions without progress.
1. Resume — pick up where we left off
2. Partial delivery — deliver completed tasks, defer rest to pool
3. Discard — abandon sprint, move all tasks to pool, delete branches
4. Discuss
```

**Step 4 — Failure handling:**
If any activity fails:
1. Save checkpoint
2. Report error with agent's assessment
3. Gate: retry / skip (if skippable) / pause / discuss
4. Never silently continue
```

### 5.15 `/gse:deliver` — Deploy & Recovery Extensions (NEW — G-003, G-009)

```markdown
### Deploy Step (added after Step 4 — Tag Release)

If `git.post_tag_hook` is configured:
1. Execute the hook: `bash -c "$post_tag_hook"`
2. If success: report "Deployed successfully"
3. If failure → **Gate**:
   ```
   Deployment failed (exit code X). Options:
   1. Retry deployment
   2. Rollback tag: git tag -d v<version>
   3. Investigate manually (pause)
   4. Discuss
   ```

### Safety Backup (added as Step 0 — before any merge)

Before EVERY destructive git operation:
```bash
git tag gse-backup/sprint-NN-pre-merge-<feat> $(git rev-parse gse/sprint-NN/integration)
```

Recovery if something goes wrong:
```bash
# Branch recovery:
git checkout -b gse/sprint-NN/feat/<name> gse-backup/sprint-NN-<feat>-deleted

# Merge reversal:
git reset --hard gse-backup/sprint-NN-pre-merge-<feat>
```

Cleanup: delete backup tags older than `git.backup_retention_days` during deliver.
```

### 5.16 State Schemas (NEW — G-004, G-005, G-006)

**status.yaml schema (spec §12.4):**

```

**Sprint Freeze — Design Mechanics (spec §3.1 / lifecycle guardrail 3):**

The spec-level *Sprint Freeze* guardrail materializes as follows:

- **Conceptual trigger:** *the sprint plan status is completed* → **Concrete realization:** `.gse/plan.yaml` contains `status: completed`
- **Conceptual state:** *the number of the sprint in progress* → **Concrete realization:** `.gse/status.yaml` → `current_sprint: N`

**Writeable window:** a sprint is writeable by activities only while `.gse/plan.yaml` exists with `status: active`. When `/gse:deliver` Step 9 sets `status: completed`, the sprint becomes frozen for write operations.

**Activities that MUST consult `.gse/plan.yaml.status` before any write to `.gse/backlog.yaml` or transition of a TASK:**

- `/gse:task` (creates a new TASK)
- `/gse:produce` (transitions TASK `planned` → `in-progress` → `review`)
- `/gse:fix` (transitions TASK `review` → `fixing` → `done`)
- `/gse:review` (adds RVW findings, transitions TASK `in-progress` → `review`)

**Activities exempt from the Sprint Freeze preflight** (operate only on closed sprints or do not mutate TASK state within a frozen sprint): `/gse:compound`, `/gse:integrate`, `/gse:pause`, `/gse:resume`, `/gse:go`, `/gse:status`, `/gse:health`, `/gse:backlog`, `/gse:learn`, `/gse:hug`, `/gse:collect`, `/gse:assess`, `/gse:plan --strategic`, `/gse:deploy`, `/gse:deliver`.

**Promotion sequence for option 1 of the Sprint Freeze Gate:**

1. The agent invokes the mode-appropriate opening sequence inline:
   - **Lightweight mode:** `/gse:plan --strategic`
   - **Full mode:** `/gse:collect` > `/gse:assess` > `/gse:plan --strategic`
2. `/gse:plan --strategic` increments `.gse/status.yaml → current_sprint` from N to N+1 and creates a fresh `.gse/plan.yaml` with `status: active` and a clean `workflow` array.
3. Once the new sprint is active, the originally-invoked activity (`/gse:task`, `/gse:produce`, `/gse:fix`, or `/gse:review`) resumes its normal Step 1 in the new sprint context.

**Persistence:** no new field is added to `.gse/status.yaml`. The source of truth for sprint freeze is `.gse/plan.yaml.status`. `current_sprint` in `.gse/status.yaml` continues to hold the number of the sprint in progress, whether frozen or active.

**Dashboard Sync — Design Mechanics (spec §7 automatic regeneration policy):**

The *automatic regeneration policy* declared in the spec materializes as two complementary mechanisms, plus a failure-surfacing subsystem.

**1. Hook-based regeneration (primary mechanism):**
- Trigger: any invocation of an editor tool (`Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`) on any file.
- Action: the hook invokes `python3 "$(cat ~/.gse-one)/tools/dashboard.py" --if-stale`. The `--if-stale` flag makes the tool self-arbitrating: it reads the debounce window from `.gse/config.yaml → dashboard.regen_debounce_seconds` (default: 5 seconds, fallback if the field is absent or malformed), compares the max mtime of `.gse/**/*.yaml` and `docs/sprints/**/*.md` against the mtime of `docs/dashboard.html`, and regenerates only if state is newer AND the last regeneration is older than the debounce window.
- Cross-platform realization (**three separate matcher entries** per platform for maximum portability — no regex reliance, ensures identical behavior on Claude Code, Cursor, and opencode including local-model setups):
  - Claude Code: `plugin/hooks/hooks.claude.json` → `PostToolUse` with three entries: `matcher: "Edit"`, `matcher: "Write"`, `matcher: "MultiEdit"`, each sharing the same command.
  - Cursor: `plugin/hooks/hooks.cursor.json` → `postToolUse` with the same three entries.
  - opencode: inside `plugin/opencode/plugins/gse-guardrails.ts`, the `tool.execute.after` handler dispatches on `input?.tool ∈ {"edit", "write", "multiedit"}` via a plain `includes()` check.
- All three implementations call the same Python tool (`dashboard.py --if-stale`), guaranteeing identical behavior across platforms.

**2. Explicit-call regeneration (secondary, belt-and-suspenders):**
- Six activities call `dashboard.py` explicitly at the end of their workflow: `/gse:hug`, `/gse:go`, `/gse:produce`, `/gse:review`, `/gse:deliver`, `/gse:compound`. These are kept as-is — they provide a guaranteed pulse at every major checkpoint even if the hook is unavailable (e.g., platform does not register the hook, tool registry `~/.gse-one` is missing).
- These explicit calls do NOT use `--if-stale`. They unconditionally regenerate, which is acceptable: the debounce in `--if-stale` prevents the hook from firing right after, avoiding double work.

**3. Failure visibility (ensures users are never silently misinformed):**
- When `dashboard.py` encounters an internal exception (YAML parse error, file I/O failure, template error, etc.), its top-level `try/except` writes a marker file `.gse/.dashboard-error.yaml` containing a timestamp, a human-readable message, and a traceback.
- When the hook wrapper (the Python one-liner invoked by the PostToolUse hook) detects a non-zero exit code from the `dashboard.py` subprocess (e.g., `dashboard.py` crashed before reaching its own exception handler), it writes a minimal marker: `timestamp`, `message: "dashboard.py exited with code N"`, and the captured stderr. This is the double-defense layer — it covers catastrophic failures where `dashboard.py` cannot write the marker itself.
- On the next successful dashboard regeneration, `dashboard.py` reads `.gse/.dashboard-error.yaml` if present, injects a prominent red warning banner at the top of the generated HTML with the recorded timestamp and message, then deletes the marker. The banner reappears only if a new failure occurs.
- Marker file format:
  ```yaml
  timestamp: "2026-04-19T14:32:15Z"
  message: "YAML parse error in .gse/plan.yaml at line 42"
  traceback: |
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  ```

**Configuration:** a new field `dashboard.regen_debounce_seconds` is added to the `config.yaml` template (default: 5). The field is optional; if absent, `dashboard.py --if-stale` falls back to 5 seconds.

**Failure modes and fallbacks:**
- Tool registry `~/.gse-one` missing → hook exits silently (`os.path.isfile` guard), no marker, no user error — same behavior as any other `~/.gse-one`-dependent tool.
- `.gse/` missing in the current working directory (e.g., user is editing a non-GSE project with the plugin installed globally) → `dashboard.py --if-stale` exits 0 silently without creating any files. The hook wrapper does not treat this as a failure and does not write an error marker.
- `dashboard.py` fails inside its logic → marker written by the try/except; user sees banner on next regen.
- `dashboard.py` fails before try/except (very rare — syntax/import error) → hook wrapper captures non-zero exit and writes minimal marker.
- Hook wrapper itself fails → no marker (but this is a Python one-liner with no dependencies; extremely unlikely).

**Git Identity Verification — Design Mechanics (spec P12.6 Git Identity Gate):**

The *Git Identity Verification* invariant declared in the spec materializes as a preflight check in activities that create commits programmatically.

**Detection logic:**
1. Run `git --version` to confirm git is installed. If exit code is non-zero (typically 127), abort the activity with: *"git is not installed on this system. GSE-One requires git — please install it first."* No Gate is shown.
2. Query identity at both scopes:
   - Global: `git config --global user.name`, `git config --global user.email`.
   - Local: `git config --local user.name`, `git config --local user.email` (only meaningful inside a git repo; outside, these return non-zero — treat as "absent").
3. If both name AND email are set at EITHER scope (global OR local) → identity OK, proceed with the commit.
4. If any of the four required values is missing → trigger the Git Identity Gate.

**Gate options → concrete actions:**

| Option | Shell command(s) | Prompt to user |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| 1. Set global identity | `git config --global user.name "<name>"` + `git config --global user.email "<email>"` | Ask for name, then email (one at a time for beginners). Validate email format (`@` + dotted domain). |
| 2. Set local identity  | `git config --local user.name "<name>"` + `git config --local user.email "<email>"` | Same prompts as option 1. |
| 3. Quick placeholder   | `git config --local user.name "GSE User"` + `git config --local user.email "user@local"` | No prompt. After execution, print a reminder: *"Placeholder identity set locally for this project. If you plan to share or push this repo, run `/gse:hug --update` or update manually with `git config --global user.name/email`."* |
| 4. I'll set it myself  | (none) | Agent prints a copy-paste block with the two `git config --global ...` commands and waits for user confirmation ("done" / "ok"). On confirmation, the agent re-runs detection. If identity still missing, the agent re-presents the Gate. |
| 5. Discuss             | (none) | Agent explains the scope difference (global = all your projects; local = this project only; placeholder = disposable for throwaway work), the fact that commits on pushed branches are publicly visible, then re-presents options 1-4. |

**Email validation rule (options 1 and 2):** the agent accepts the email if it contains exactly one `@`, with a non-empty local part before `@` and a domain part after `@` that contains at least one `.` with non-empty labels on both sides of that dot. On validation failure, the agent re-prompts with: *"That doesn't look like a valid email address. Could you enter it again? (e.g., you@example.com)"*. No external validation (no DNS lookup).

**Placeholder reminder (option 3):** the reminder fires once, immediately after the placeholder is set. It is NOT repeated on subsequent activities — we rely on the user's awareness. This reflects the "cheap escape hatch for quick tests" intent of option 3; making it noisy would defeat its purpose.

**Activities that MUST invoke the preflight:**
- `/gse:hug` Step 4 — foundational commit
- `/gse:go` Step 2.7 — auto-fix commit when baseline is missing

Additional activities that SHOULD invoke the preflight in future releases (tracked as AMÉL follow-ups):
- `/gse:pause` — auto-commits of uncommitted work
- `/gse:deliver` — merge commits on `main`
- `/gse:task`, `/gse:produce`, `/gse:fix` — feature branch commits

**Implementation pattern:** the preflight is NOT extracted into a separate shared file. Each concerned activity SKILL.md inlines the detection + Gate sequence in its Step 4 / Step 2.7 / Step 0 block. Rationale: inlining avoids indirection when the agent reads a skill and removes dependency on loading additional context. The orchestrator documents the canonical invariant (single source of truth for the Gate shape and options).

**Exempt activities:** read-only and planning activities that do not create commits (`/gse:status`, `/gse:health`, `/gse:backlog`, `/gse:learn`, `/gse:resume`, `/gse:collect`, `/gse:assess`, `/gse:plan`, `/gse:reqs`, `/gse:design`, `/gse:preview`, `/gse:tests`, `/gse:review`, `/gse:compound`, `/gse:integrate`, `/gse:deploy`).

**Root-Cause Discipline — Design Mechanics (spec P16 "Root-Cause Discipline before patching"):**

The discipline materializes as a 4-step sub-protocol applied inside any fix flow. The orchestrator owns the invariant; `/gse:fix` Step 3 is the canonical in-lifecycle implementation; ad-hoc bug reports outside the lifecycle trigger the same protocol via the orchestrator.

**Step-by-step mechanics:**

| Step | Agent action | Blocking conditions |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **1. Read** | Open the relevant source file(s) via the Read tool in the current turn. Agent records which files were read. | A file must have been read in the current turn (not in a previous turn, not cached from context compaction) before it can be patched. |
| **2. Symptom** | Extract observable fact from the report. If report is vague, prompt the user for ONE concrete piece of evidence (console error, screenshot, specific interaction). | Empty/vague symptoms are not acceptable — the agent cannot proceed to step 3 without a specific observable. |
| **3. Hypothesis + Evidence** | Write in chat: hypothesis, proposed test, P15 confidence tag. Run the test (execute a command, inspect a file, run a unit test, ask the user to perform a concrete action). | If evidence contradicts → loop back to step 3 with a new hypothesis. If evidence confirms → proceed to step 4. Do NOT skip to step 4 without a confirming test result. |
| **4. Patch** | Apply the fix. Commit trailer MUST include `Root cause:` and `Evidence:` lines. | Commit is refused if these trailer lines are absent (can be enforced by a future pre-commit hook — for now, relies on the activity writing the commit message). |

**Counter persistence:**

| Field | File | Lifecycle |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `fix_attempts_on_current_symptom` | `.gse/status.yaml` | Persists across `/gse:pause` / `/gse:resume`. Reset on user confirmation of resolution, explicit symptom change, or sprint promotion (`/gse:plan --strategic` sets it back to 0 at the same time as sprint counter advance). |

**Increment logic:** after a patch is applied (step 4), the agent asks the user to re-verify the symptom (or automatically re-runs the evidence test if available). If the symptom persists, the counter increments. If resolved, the counter resets to 0.

**Threshold logic (read `profile.yaml → dimensions.it_expertise`):**

| Expertise | Threshold | Escalation action |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| `beginner` | 2 | Freeze patching; spawn devil-advocate in focused-review mode (below). |
| `intermediate` | 3 | Same. |
| `expert` | 4 | Same. |

**Devil-advocate focused-review input format (on escalation):**

```yaml
mode: focused-review
symptom: "<precise observable>"
hypotheses_tried:
  - hypothesis: "<text>"
    evidence: "<result that contradicted>"
    confidence: Moderate
  - hypothesis: "<text>"
    evidence: "<result>"
    confidence: High
patches_applied:
  - file: "src/foo.js"
    summary: "<what was changed>"
    commit: "<hash>"
files_under_suspicion:
  - "src/foo.js"
  - "src/bar.js"
  - "index.html"
```

The devil-advocate runs its standard checklist (hallucination hunt, assumption challenge, complaisance detection, temporal validity, etc.) **focused on the symptom** and returns findings. The agent displays the findings and MUST address at least one finding (fix it, explicitly dismiss with a DEC-, or request user input) before any further patch on this symptom is authorized.

**Ad-hoc bug reports outside the lifecycle:**

The orchestrator detects user messages matching bug-report patterns ("doesn't work", "broken", "not working", "expected X but got Y", screenshots of errors, pasted console output) **outside of `/gse:fix`** (e.g., during PRODUCE, after DELIVER, or in idle state). On detection, the orchestrator applies the Root-Cause Discipline protocol inline, just as `/gse:fix` Step 3 would — same 4 steps, same counter, same escalation. The counter is a single transversal field (`fix_attempts_on_current_symptom` in `status.yaml`), not scoped per activity.

**Activities concerned:**
- `/gse:fix` (canonical, in-lifecycle) — applied in Step 3
- Any activity where a user reports a symptom (PRODUCE, post-DELIVER idle, etc.) — orchestrator-driven

**Exempt activities:** read-only and planning activities (`/gse:status`, `/gse:health`, `/gse:backlog`, `/gse:learn`, `/gse:resume`, `/gse:collect`, `/gse:assess`, `/gse:plan`, `/gse:reqs`, `/gse:design`, `/gse:preview`, `/gse:tests`, `/gse:compound`, `/gse:integrate`).

**Failure modes:**
- User refuses to provide a concrete observable at step 2 → agent proceeds with a *best-effort* symptom description but flags the uncertainty in the hypothesis confidence tag (max Moderate).
- Evidence test requires a user action (e.g., "open the console and tell me what you see") → agent waits; no counter increment until the user responds and a patch is attempted.
- Devil-advocate returns no findings (the focused review confirms the code is sound) → the escalation is logged as a DEC-, the counter is reset, and the agent suggests looking at external causes (environment, cache, network, permissions) with the user.

**Scope Reconciliation & Inform-Tier Summary — Design Mechanics (spec P6 Scope Reconciliation + P16 Inform-Tier Decisions Summary):**

Two complementary closure mechanisms for creator activities. The first (Scope Reconciliation) detects *what* was delivered outside the plan; the second (Inform-Tier Summary) detects *how* the delivered work was shaped (micro-decisions). Both fire at the end of creator activities.

**1. Scope Reconciliation — deterministic git-diff-based detection:**

*Applies to:* `/gse:produce`, `/gse:task` (activities that produce code or executable artefacts).

**a. Record activity start (at the start of the activity):**

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Save the result to `.gse/status.yaml → activity_start_sha`. Done right after the git setup step (feature branch / worktree created) so the diff captures only the activity's contribution.

**b. Compute deltas (at activity closure, before Finalize):**

```bash
git diff --name-status {activity_start_sha}..HEAD
git log {activity_start_sha}..HEAD --pretty=format:"%H%n%B%n---"
```

The first command gives the list of changed files (status: A/M/D/R). The second gives each commit's body, from which the agent parses the `Traces:` trailer line (already mandated by the produce/task commit format).

**c. Load planned scope:** read `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/reqs.md` (list of REQ-NNN) and `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/design.md` (list of DEC-NNN) to build `planned_ids = {REQ-001, REQ-002, DES-001, ...}`.

**d. Categorize each delta:**

| Condition | Category |
|-----------|----------|
| File added, no commit touching it has `Traces:` listing any `planned_id` | `ADDED out of scope` |
| File modified, commits touching it introduce `Traces:` IDs outside `planned_ids` | `MODIFIED beyond plan` |
| REQ or DEC in `planned_ids` with zero commits referencing it | `OMITTED` |
| Otherwise | `aligned` (no output) |

**e. Present the Gate if any non-`aligned` delta exists.**

**f. Execute the chosen option:**

- **Option 1 (Accept as deliberate):** append a single grouped DEC-NNN to `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/decisions.md`:
  ```markdown
  ### DEC-{next_id} — Out-of-scope additions during {activity} (TASK-{ID})
  
  During implementation of TASK-{ID}, the following items were delivered beyond the approved plan:
  - `{path/to/file1}` — {one-line rationale}
  - `{path/to/file2}` — {one-line rationale}
  
  Grouped rationale: {thematic summary — e.g. "user convenience additions that emerged during implementation and were judged individually low-risk"}
  Reconciled at: {timestamp}
  Traces: {associated REQ-NNN if any}
  ```
  For OMITTED items: move their derived TASK to backlog pool with `status: planned`, `sprint: null`.

- **Option 2 (Revert out-of-scope):** for each ADDED file, revert the originating commit(s). Verify the worktree still builds.

- **Option 3 (Amend):** append a **lightweight** REQ-NNN / DEC-NNN to the relevant sprint artefact — **no elicitation Gate, no approval cycle**. Format example:
  ```markdown
  ### REQ-{next_id} — {short title} [amended during {activity}]
  
  Acceptance criterion: {one line}
  Rationale: emerged during {activity}; reconciled at {timestamp}.
  ```

- **Option 4 (Discuss):** per-delta mixed decisions — iterate through each delta with its own 1/2/3/discuss choice.

**g. Clear `activity_start_sha`** to empty string after the reconciliation completes.

**2. Inform-Tier Summary — agent-maintained decision list:**

*Applies to:* `/gse:design`, `/gse:preview`, `/gse:produce`, `/gse:task`.

**a. During the activity:** the agent internally tracks Inform-tier decisions as it makes them. This is a conversation-scope list (not persisted to disk during the activity); it's assembled from the agent's own Inform-tier actions per P7.

Typical examples: *"chose `crypto.randomUUID()` over the uuid package"*, *"folder `src/components/` over `src/ui/`"*, *"HashRouter over BrowserRouter"*, *"integer cents over float euros for money"*.

**b. At activity closure:** present the list. If empty, display the standard empty-state message (*"No inform-tier decisions made this activity — all choices were Gated."*).

**c. On "Accept all":** append an `## Inform-tier Decisions` section to the activity's artefact:

| Activity | Destination |
|----------|-------------|
| `/gse:design` | `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/design.md` |
| `/gse:preview` | `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/preview.md` |
| `/gse:produce` | In the produce report (commit message body) AND as a section in `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/produce-{TASK-ID}.md` if such artefact exists |
| `/gse:task` | In the ad-hoc task commit message body |

**d. On "Promote":** for each selected decision, walk through a standard Gate (Question / Context / Options with consequence horizons per P8 / Discuss). If the user picks an alternative, the agent rolls back the inform-tier choice and applies the new one. The resulting DEC-NNN is added to `decisions.md`.

**Ordering at activity closure:**

Scope Reconciliation runs FIRST (material deltas), Inform-Tier Summary SECOND (design micro-choices). Both run before the activity's Finalize step (status.yaml update, dashboard regen).

**Exempt activities** (neither mechanism applies): `/gse:status`, `/gse:health`, `/gse:backlog`, `/gse:learn`, `/gse:resume`, `/gse:collect`, `/gse:assess`, `/gse:plan`, `/gse:reqs`, `/gse:tests`, `/gse:review`, `/gse:fix`, `/gse:deliver`, `/gse:compound`, `/gse:integrate`, `/gse:deploy`, `/gse:hug`, `/gse:go`, `/gse:pause`.

**Failure modes:**
- `activity_start_sha` missing or invalid (interrupted session, Micro mode, `git.strategy: none`) → skip Scope Reconciliation with a one-line Inform note ("Scope Reconciliation skipped: no git baseline recorded"). Proceed with Inform-Tier Summary normally.
- Commits without `Traces:` trailer (user commited manually, or legacy commits) → agent can still enumerate files but cannot match them to planned IDs. Treats the files as unlabeled and asks the user to clarify in a one-shot prompt.
- Plan artefacts missing (`reqs.md` or `design.md` absent — Lightweight mode, or early sprint) → skip Scope Reconciliation; Inform-Tier Summary still applies.

**Intent Capture — Design Mechanics (spec §3 Step 5 Intent Capture, P6 INT- prefix):**

The *Intent Capture* flow formalizes the greenfield onboarding step that precedes `/gse:collect`. It replaces the pre-v0.28 "Intent-first mode" (which was beginner-only and did not produce a formal artefact).

**Trigger detection (in `/gse:go` Step 7):**

1. Run the project file scan (same exclusion rules as `/gse:go` Step 1: `.cursor`, `.claude`, `.gse`, `.git`, `.vscode`, `.idea`, `.fleet`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `target`, `dist`, `build`).
2. Count **source files** = non-excluded files that are not pure documentation (`*.md`, `*.txt`, `LICENSE`, `README`). Greenfield = `source_files_count == 0`.
3. Check for existing intent artefact: `os.path.isfile("docs/intent.md")` AND its frontmatter `id` starts with `INT-`. If present, skip Intent Capture (intent already captured; use existing).
4. If greenfield AND no intent artefact → enter Intent Capture.

**Artefact file (canonical template at `gse-one/src/templates/intent.md`):**

```markdown
---
id: INT-001
artefact_type: intent
title: "{project_name} — Project Intent"
sprint: 0
status: approved
created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
author: pair
---

# {project_name} — Project Intent

## Description (verbatim user statement)

> {exact user statement, quoted literally — no paraphrasing at this step}

## Reformulated understanding

{agent's reformulation in plain language, validated by the user in the elicitation loop}

## Users

- {single user / small shared group / public / specific role — e.g., "single user, no accounts"}

## Boundaries (explicit out-of-scope)

- {thing 1 — e.g., "no multi-device sync"}
- {thing 2 — e.g., "no server component"}
- ...

## Open questions

_Optional section. Lists ambiguities to resolve in downstream activities, each tagged with its natural home._

- **OQ-001** — single user or multi-user? (`resolves_in: PLAN`, `impact: scope-shaping`, `status: pending`)
- **OQ-002** — which categories at start? (`resolves_in: REQS`, `impact: behavioral`, `status: pending`)
```

**Field semantics:**

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `id` | `INT-001` on first capture. If the user pivots the project later (new intent), the existing artefact is renamed to `docs/archive/intent-v01.md` (preserving its original `id: INT-001`), and a new `docs/intent.md` is created with `id: INT-002`. The old `INT-001` is kept read-only for historical traceability. |
| `status` | `draft` during elicitation, `approved` once the user has confirmed the reformulated understanding. |
| `sprint` | Always `0` — intent precedes any sprint. |

**Elicitation loop (agent behavior during Step 5):**

1. Ask the intent question in the user's chosen language (from HUG profile). For beginners: one open-ended question. For intermediate/expert: may batch with follow-ups on users, boundaries, domain.
2. Capture the user's **first verbatim response** — this becomes the *Description* section, quoted literally. Do NOT edit or paraphrase.
3. Reformulate in plain language and present as bullet list. Ask for confirmation. Iterate until the user confirms.
4. For **Users** and **Boundaries**: if not explicit in the user's statement, ask brief follow-ups. Don't assume.
5. For **Open questions**: the agent lists its own remaining ambiguities. The user may add or dismiss.
6. Write `docs/intent.md` atomically (all sections at once) when the user approves.

**Integration with downstream activities:**

- `/gse:collect` (internal mode) now starts with **Step 0: Verify intent exists**. If greenfield and no `docs/intent.md`, the agent inlines Intent Capture (re-runs `/gse:go` Step 7 inline) before the inventory step.
- `/gse:assess` reads `docs/intent.md` and parses the *Open questions* section. Questions tagged `natural home: ASSESS` are surfaced as explicit gaps to resolve.
- `/gse:plan --strategic` uses the backlog items seeded during Intent Capture (which carry `traces.derives_from: [INT-001]`).
- `/gse:reqs` reads the intent artefact to cross-check that all user-stated goals are covered by at least one REQ. Requirements get `traces.derives_from: [INT-001, ...]`.

**Pivot / re-capture command:** out of scope for v0.28 — will be added later as `/gse:intent --pivot` or similar. For now, if the user wants to replace the intent, they manually archive `docs/intent.md` and re-run `/gse:go` on a greenfield-looking project (or use `/gse:hug --update` to reset the first-project flag).

**Open Questions Resolution — Design Mechanics (spec P6 Open Questions + activity-entry scan):**

The *Open Questions* mechanism is the operational backbone that makes the `resolves_in` tag useful across the lifecycle.

**Artefact location:** open questions live in a dedicated `## Open Questions` markdown section at the end of the artefact that raises them. Typical origin artefacts:
- `docs/intent.md` — questions raised during Intent Capture (greenfield projects)
- `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/assess.md` — questions raised by gap analysis
- `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/reqs.md` — questions discovered during requirements elicitation
- `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/design.md` — questions deferred to later DESIGN decisions

**Format (markdown, human-readable, lightly parseable):**

Each entry is a bullet with sub-fields on indented lines:

```markdown
## Open Questions

- **OQ-001** — single user or multi-user?
  - resolves_in: PLAN
  - impact: scope-shaping
  - status: pending
  - raised_at: INT-001

- **OQ-002** — which categories at start?
  - resolves_in: REQS
  - impact: behavioral
  - status: pending
  - raised_at: INT-001
```

Once resolved, the entry is updated in place (status flipped, resolution fields populated):

```markdown
- **OQ-001** — single user or multi-user?
  - resolves_in: PLAN
  - impact: scope-shaping
  - status: resolved
  - raised_at: INT-001
  - resolved_at: "2026-04-19T14:32:00Z"
  - resolved_in: PLAN
  - answer: "single user, no accounts"
  - answered_by: user
  - confidence: Verified
  - traces: [DEC-005]
```

**Activity-entry scan implementation:**

At Step 0 of `/gse:assess`, `/gse:plan`, `/gse:reqs`, and `/gse:design`, the agent:

1. **Enumerate sources** — list all artefacts that may carry `## Open Questions` sections:
   - Always: `docs/intent.md`
   - If `.gse/status.yaml → current_sprint` ≥ 1: `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/*.md` for the current sprint
2. **Parse each section** — for each source file, scan for the `## Open Questions` heading and parse the bullet entries. Extract `id`, `resolves_in`, `impact`, `status`.
3. **Filter** — keep only entries with `status: pending` AND `resolves_in == <current_activity>`.
4. **Short-circuit** — if the filtered list is empty, skip Step 0 entirely and proceed to Step 1.
5. **Enter Open Questions Gate** — otherwise, present the questions according to the user's `decision_involvement` mode (see below).

**Gate behavior by `decision_involvement`:**

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `autonomous` | The agent generates proposed answers using (a) the intent artefact, (b) the project profile (domain, team context), (c) GSE convention defaults (e.g., browser-local storage for solo single-user web apps). For low-impact questions (`impact: behavioral` or `cosmetic`), the answers are applied silently and reported as Inform-tier. For high-impact questions (`impact: scope-shaping` or `architectural`), a Gate is raised per question for explicit user validation. |
| `collaborative` (default) | Per-question or per-theme Gate. Agent proposes answer + rationale + consequence horizons (P8). User validates, modifies, or rejects. `answered_by: user` after confirmation, `answered_by: agent` if user accepts verbatim (recorded as meta-decision). Theme batching (P9) activates when ≥ 3 questions — the agent groups them by detected theme (e.g., *users & data / domain model / UX & output*) to reduce cognitive load. |
| `supervised` | Each question is a neutral full Gate — the agent does not pre-answer. It presents the question, lists candidate options if relevant, and waits for the user's answer. `answered_by: user`. This mode is strictly more demanding — use it for high-stakes projects or first-time learners of the methodology. |

**Recording resolutions (all modes):**

For each resolved question, the agent:

1. Updates the origin artefact's `## Open Questions` entry in place (sets `status: resolved`, fills `resolved_at`, `resolved_in`, `answer`, `answered_by`, `confidence`, `traces`).
2. If the resolution is substantial (scope-shaping OR architectural OR otherwise judged non-trivial), creates a `DEC-NNN` entry in `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/decisions.md` with `traces.derives_from: [OQ-NNN]` and a short rationale.
3. If the resolution has `impact: scope-shaping` AND the current sprint plan exists (`.gse/plan.yaml`), propagates the sizing delta: update affected TASK entries in `backlog.yaml`, and if the total exceeds the sprint budget, triggers a `/gse:plan --tactical` Gate.

**Mode mapping to spec P7 tiers:**

| Mode | Low-impact question | High-impact question |
|------|--------------------|---------------------|
| `autonomous` | Auto (Inform-tier logged) | Gate (escalated) |
| `collaborative` | Inform or Gate (per agent judgment, default Gate) | Gate |
| `supervised` | Gate | Gate |

**Provenance and cross-activity flow:**

- A question raised in `INT-001` with `resolves_in: PLAN` will be resolved at the first `/gse:plan --strategic` call — not before, not after.
- A question raised in `docs/sprints/sprint-02/assess.md` with `resolves_in: DESIGN` will wait until `/gse:design` of the same sprint.
- If an activity is skipped in the current sprint's workflow (e.g., `/gse:preview` skipped for a CLI project), questions targeting that activity roll forward to the next lifecycle boundary where they make sense, or are escalated as a warning at DELIVER.

**Failure modes:**

- Malformed `## Open Questions` section (missing fields, invalid `resolves_in` values) → agent reports a parse warning, skips the malformed entry, continues with the rest. The user is asked to fix the file if the malformed entry is ambiguous.
- A question has `resolves_in: PLAN` but no `/gse:plan` is ever called (Micro mode) → the question remains `pending` until `/gse:compound` or `/gse:deliver`, which surface pending OQs as a reminder in the release notes.
- A question is resolved outside the agent (user edits the file manually) → the next activity-entry scan reads the updated status and respects it.

**Scope-resolve as Step 0 of `/gse:plan`:** the transversal activity-entry scan IS the scope-resolve mechanism. `/gse:plan --strategic` Step 0 scans for `resolves_in: PLAN` questions; if any have `impact: scope-shaping`, the Gate explicitly frames them as "scope-shaping questions — resolve before sprint selection". No separate `/gse:scope` skill is introduced.

**Config Application Transparency — Design Mechanics (spec P7 Config Application Transparency):**

The discipline surfaces every materialization of a `config.yaml` field with user-visible consequences as a one-line Inform message. No Gate, no new state — just a disciplined label at the moment of action.

**Standard format:**

```
Config applied: <field_path> = <value> (<origin> — to change: /gse:hug --update or edit .gse/config.yaml)
```

Where:
- `<field_path>` is the full dotted path (e.g., `git.strategy`, `testing.coverage.minimum`).
- `<value>` is the current applied value.
- `<origin>` is either *methodology default* or *user choice*, determined at display time by comparing the current value to the canonical default in `gse-one/src/templates/config.yaml`.

**Beginner adaptation (per P9):**

For `it_expertise: beginner`, the field path is translated to plain language and the technical "to change" command is replaced with a soft hint:

```
Config applied: I'm using separate workspaces for each task (default — say "I'd prefer a simpler setup" if you want to change)
```

**Origin classification algorithm:**

```python
# pseudo
default_value = read_template_field("git.strategy")      # e.g., "worktree"
current_value = read_config_field("git.strategy")         # e.g., "worktree" or "branch-only"
origin = "methodology default" if current_value == default_value else "user choice"
```

No persistent state is needed — the classification is computed fresh at each materialization.

**Fields covered in v0.30:**

| Activity | Field | Materialization point |
|----------|-------|----------------------|
| `/gse:produce` | `git.strategy` | Step 2 (Git Setup) — creates feature branch and optionally worktree |
| `/gse:task` | `git.strategy` | Step 4 (Git Setup) — same as produce |

**Extension pattern for future fields:**

When a new field with user-visible consequences is added (e.g., `testing.coverage.minimum` enforced at `/gse:tests`, or `git.tag_on_deliver` at `/gse:deliver`), the concerned activity's spec adds an Inform line using the standard format at the relevant step. No change to the orchestrator or spec P7 (the rule is already general). Each activity's SKILL.md documents which fields it materializes in a dedicated note.

**Scope of "user-visible consequences":**

Not every config field triggers the Inform line — only those that cause a concrete action the user might notice:
- Creates files or directories (e.g., worktree directories)
- Modifies git state (branches, tags)
- Enforces a hard threshold (coverage minimum)
- Changes delivery behavior (tag, cleanup)

Fields that only affect internal agent behavior (e.g., `interaction.verbosity`, `decisions.tier_bias`) do NOT trigger the Inform — they are transparent by design.

**Failure modes:**

- Template file not found (cannot compute origin) → skip the origin classification, emit the note without it: *"Config applied: `<field>` = `<value>` (to change: /gse:hug --update or edit .gse/config.yaml)"*
- Config field missing from config.yaml (should not happen — HUG always fills defaults) → agent emits a warning and falls back to the methodology default value before proceeding.

**Methodology Feedback — Design Mechanics (spec §3 COMPOUND Axe 2 + P14 methodology self-improvement):**

The methodology-feedback flow operates entirely inside `/gse:compound` Axe 2 and `/gse:integrate` Axe 2. No new skill, no new artefact type, no new profile flag.

**Source material (scanned during COMPOUND Axe 2):**

| Source | What to look for |
|--------|------------------|
| `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/review.md` | Findings tagged `[METHOD-FEEDBACK]` (process-level issues, not product-level) |
| `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/decisions.md` | DEC- entries with attribute `type: methodology-deviation` (the agent deviated from the methodology and logged why) |
| `.gse/status.yaml → activity_history[*].notes` | Free-text notes attached to activity completions |
| Conversation context | Friction points, user explicit complaints, or recurring questions the agent encountered during the sprint (agent subjective memory) |

**Convention for logging during the sprint:** the agent adds a `[METHOD-FEEDBACK]` tag or `type: methodology-deviation` attribute whenever it observes a process-level friction, deviation, or improvement opportunity. The tag is **optional** — the agent is not required to log every friction. It is a signal that compound Axe 2 can consume. For v0.31, the tag convention is documented; its broader adoption in `/gse:review` and `/gse:fix` can follow in future releases if the source coverage proves insufficient.

**Closure Gate at end of Axe 2 (3 options):**

After synthesizing the observations into themes, the agent presents:

```
I've consolidated N methodology observations from this sprint, grouped into M themes.
How should I route them?

1. Export as a local feedback document only
   → docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/methodology-feedback.md
   You can share or submit it manually (email, chat, issue tracker).

2. Propose GitHub tickets (quality-filtered, theme-grouped, deduplicated)
   → I'll walk you through each proposed issue for validation before
     submission to the GSE-One plugin repository via /gse:integrate Axe 2.

3. Both — export AND propose tickets.

4. Discuss — I'll show a one-line-per-observation summary first.
```

**Output A — local export file:**

Written at `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/methodology-feedback.md` when option 1 or 3 is chosen. Structure:

```markdown
---
artefact_type: methodology-feedback
title: "Sprint {NN} — Methodology Feedback"
sprint: {NN}
created: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
status: exported
---

# Sprint {NN} — Methodology Feedback

## Summary

{1-3 sentences giving the overall experience of this sprint with the methodology}

## Observations grouped by theme

### Theme 1: {name}

**Observation:** {specific, with context — file, step, quote, or artefact ref}

**Source:** {list of artefact references — RVW-NNN, DEC-NNN, activity in activity_history, …}

**User quote** (if relevant): *"{verbatim}"*

**Proposed improvement:** {actionable suggestion}

### Theme 2: ...
```

**Output B — ticket proposals (Gate path):**

For each theme that passes the quality filter, the agent presents a per-theme Gate:

```
**Proposed ticket 1 of N:**

Title: {~60 chars, imperative or descriptive}
Label: enhancement | bug | documentation
Body:
  Context: {what the user was trying to do}
  Observation: {what went wrong or was awkward, with source refs}
  Proposed change: {actionable suggestion}
  Sources: {list of RVW/DEC/activity refs from the sprint}
Dedup check: {"No open issue matching keywords" | "Potential match found: #NNN"}

Options:
1. Approve — I'll create this issue via /gse:integrate Axe 2.
2. Edit — adjust title/body/label before creating.
3. Skip — exclude this ticket.
4. Discuss.
```

**Quality filter rules (hard constraints applied before proposing):**

| Rule | Check |
|------|-------|
| Concrete | The observation must cite at least one specific example (file path, timestamp, user quote, or artefact ID). Vague complaints ("it felt confusing") are dropped or requested for specification. |
| Theme-grouped | Multiple observations belonging to the same theme (e.g., "scope-lock ergonomy") are merged into a single ticket. The agent is explicit about which observations were grouped. |
| Deduplicated | Before proposing, the agent runs `gh issue list --repo <upstream> --state open --search "<theme keywords>"` and flags matches. If `gh` is unavailable, the agent proceeds with a "dedup unverified" marker and leaves the decision to the user. |
| Cap | No more than `config.yaml → compound.max_proposed_issues_per_sprint` (default: **3**) tickets proposed per sprint. If more themes qualify, the agent prioritizes by impact (HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW severity from source findings) and consolidates the rest into the local export only. |
| User-validated | Each proposal goes through a per-ticket Gate. No silent creation. |

**Dedup algorithm:**

```
# pseudo
for each proposed_theme:
    keywords = extract_keywords(proposed_theme.title)
    try:
        existing = shell("gh issue list --repo <upstream> --state open --search '{keywords}' --json number,title")
        if existing:
            proposed_theme.dedup_note = f"Potential match: {existing}"
        else:
            proposed_theme.dedup_note = "No open issue matching keywords"
    except ShellError:
        proposed_theme.dedup_note = "dedup unverified (gh unavailable)"
```

**Link with `/gse:integrate` Axe 2:**

Compound prepares the tickets as a draft set (stored transiently in `.gse/compound-tickets-draft.yaml` for handoff). `/gse:integrate` Axe 2 reads this file and executes the user-approved `gh issue create` calls. No change to integrate's skeleton — just the input quality is now higher.

**Configuration:**

New field in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
compound:
  max_proposed_issues_per_sprint: 3    # Hard cap. Raise only if sprint generates genuinely independent themes.
```

**Skipping behavior:**

- If no observations are collected (rare — typically happens on a very smooth sprint), the Gate is skipped silently and Axe 2 concludes with "No methodology observations worth escalating this sprint."
- If the user has opted out of upstream feedback entirely (e.g., `github.enabled: false`), only option 1 (local export) is offered; options 2 and 3 are hidden.

**Failure modes:**

- `plugin.json` has no `repository` field → options 2/3 are disabled; only local export is offered. Inform note displayed.
- `gh` command not installed or not authenticated → options 2/3 can still be proposed, but ticket creation in `/gse:integrate` will fail at runtime. The agent warns the user before proposing.

**Shared State — Design Mechanics (spec §3 `/gse:design` + design template section):**

Prevents the silent-duplication failure mode: a state that is logically single but implemented as N independent instances across components (e.g., a month filter that must be consistent across 3 pages but lives as 3 independent `st.selectbox` widgets — observed in training feedback).

**Artefact location:** a mandatory `## Shared State` section in `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/design.md`, between `## Data Model` and `## Technology Choices`. The section is populated during `/gse:design` Step 2.5.

**Row fields:**

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `Name` | Conceptual state name (`selected_month`, not `SelectedMonthProvider.state`). |
| `Scope` | List of components/pages/modules that read or write the state. |
| `Mechanism` | Framework-appropriate storage + synchronization (session state, URL param, global store, context, event bus, cookie, DB, etc.). |
| `Rationale` | One sentence explaining why the state must be shared (not duplicated). |
| `Traces` | REQ IDs that motivate the sharing. |

**Mandatory disclaimer for empty case:** when no shared state applies (CLI tools, pure libraries, strictly independent components), the section contains the literal sentence *"No shared state identified — components are independent."*. An empty section is not permitted — it would be indistinguishable from an oversight.

**Activation heuristic (in `/gse:design` Step 2.5):** after Step 2 (Component Decomposition), the agent walks through each component pair and asks *"Do they read or write any state that must stay consistent between them?"* If yes → row in the table. If no → move on. At the end, if the table is empty, the disclaimer is written.

**Domain adaptation (P9):**

- Web / mobile projects — typically 1-5 entries (selections, user identity, theme, navigation).
- CLI / library / scientific — often zero, disclaimer line is legitimate.
- API / backend — usually a few (request context, session, connection pool).

**Failure modes:**

- Agent overlooks a shared state piece that should have been formalized → the omission will surface in `/gse:review` (multiple components handling the same logical state independently) or in user testing. The next sprint's design should add the missing entry.
- Agent inflates the list with trivial state (local component state, ephemeral UI state) → the Rationale field acts as a filter: if it's hard to write a one-sentence reason for sharing, the state probably shouldn't be in this table.

**Preview Variants — Design Mechanics (spec §3 `/gse:preview` + Step 1.5 Variant Selection):**

`/gse:preview` officially supports two variants, selected at activity start:

| Variant | When appropriate | Output | Runnable? |
|---------|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| **static description** | All domains, default for API / CLI / library / scientific / data / arch previews | Wireframes, API examples, ASCII diagrams in `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/preview.md`. Throwaway. | No — just a description. |
| **scaffold-as-preview** | Web / mobile projects with modern framework (Vite, Next.js, Streamlit, React Native, etc.). Recommended when the scaffold cost is recovered at `/gse:produce`. | Minimal runnable project at the project root (or a sub-directory). Placeholder code marked with `PREVIEW:` comments. The scaffold becomes the starting base for `/gse:produce`. | Yes — `npm run build` / `python -m <tool>` exit 0 is the validation evidence. |

**Variant selection (Step 1.5 Gate):**

```
Question: How should the preview be produced?

1. Static description (lightweight, throwaway, any domain)
2. Scaffold-as-preview (runnable minimal project, becomes PRODUCE base)
3. Discuss
```

Default recommendation based on `config.yaml → project.domain`:

| Domain | Recommended | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `web` | scaffold | modern JS/TS frameworks have fast scaffolds; cost recovered at PRODUCE |
| `mobile` | scaffold | RN/Flutter scaffolds deliver the component shell; PRODUCE fills the logic |
| `api` | static | API contracts are better shown as request/response examples |
| `cli` | static | CLI design is about command structure + output format — text is sufficient |
| `library` | static | interface design is best shown as signatures + usage examples |
| `scientific`, `data` | static | notebooks/scripts don't need a UI scaffold; mocked data tables suffice |

**Placeholder comment convention (scaffold-as-preview only):**

Code that is known to be placeholder and must be replaced at PRODUCE is marked with `PREVIEW:` comments, idiomatic per language:

| Language family | Syntax | Example |
|-----------------|--------|---------|
| JS, TS, C, C++, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Swift | `//` | `// PREVIEW: mock data — replaced by real store in TASK-005` |
| Python, Ruby, shell, R, YAML | `#` | `# PREVIEW: hardcoded today's date — real parser added in TASK-007` |
| HTML, XML | `<!-- -->` | `<!-- PREVIEW: placeholder text — copy provided by TASK-003 -->` |
| CSS, SCSS | `/* */` | `/* PREVIEW: rough layout — final design in TASK-008 */` |

**Rules for `PREVIEW:` markers:**

- The marker MUST include a descriptor explaining what will replace it (not just `PREVIEW:`).
- Ideally, the descriptor cites the TASK ID that will replace it.
- The agent grep-scans for `PREVIEW:` at PRODUCE start (see below) to remind the user what remains.

**Integration with `/gse:produce`:**

When the current sprint used `scaffold-as-preview` (detectable by the presence of `## Scaffold` or similar section in `preview.md` + `PREVIEW:` comments in the codebase), `/gse:produce` Step 1 (Select Task) includes an **Inform-tier** scan:

```bash
grep -rn "PREVIEW:" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.html" --include="*.css" [...] .
```

The scan produces a one-shot reminder list of placeholder sites still awaiting replacement. Not a guardrail — just a visibility cue. The user decides when/how to replace them during PRODUCE work.

**Variant scope (which preview types apply):**

Only **UI** and **feature walkthrough** previews are candidates for scaffold-as-preview. The other types (API contracts, architecture diagrams, data models, import comparisons) remain static — they describe concepts that don't benefit from a runnable scaffold.

**Persistence:**

The chosen variant is recorded in the preview artefact's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
...
preview_variant: static | scaffold
scaffold_path: ""  # populated only if variant: scaffold, e.g., "./" or "frontend/"
---
```

**Failure modes:**

- Agent picks `scaffold` for a domain where it's inappropriate (e.g., library) → DEC-NNN documenting the deviation, user can reverse.
- Scaffold build fails → the PREVIEW variant cannot be validated; agent asks the user whether to debug the scaffold (continues PREVIEW) or revert to static.
- User forgets to replace all `PREVIEW:` markers before DELIVER → the DELIVER review flags them via the same grep; explicit DEC- required to ship code with remaining placeholders.



**Exempt / skip conditions:**
- Existing project (non-greenfield) → no Intent Capture; inferred implicit from existing artefacts.
- Adopted project (`/gse:go --adopt`) → no Intent Capture; the adoption flow has its own analysis (see spec §3 Adopt Mode).
- User explicit skip ("I know the process", "no need") → no `intent.md` written, Inform note logged.
- Existing `docs/intent.md` present → skip Intent Capture, use the existing artefact.

**Failure modes:**
- User refuses to describe intent → `/gse:go` proceeds to Step 6 (Complexity Assessment) without an intent artefact. A one-line Inform note is displayed: *"Intent Capture declined — I'll infer from your first sprint work. You can create `docs/intent.md` manually at any time."*
- User describes intent but declines to validate the reformulation → agent writes the artefact with `status: draft` and proceeds. The draft can be promoted to `approved` by running `/gse:go` again.

**Checkpoint schema (spec §12.5):**
```yaml
timestamp: 2026-04-11T16:30:00
user: alice
sprint: 3
phase: LC02
last_activity: /gse:produce
last_task: TASK-038
status_snapshot: <copy of status.yaml>
backlog_sprint_snapshot: <current sprint items from backlog.yaml>
git:
  current_branch: gse/sprint-03/feat/auth
  worktrees:
    - branch: gse/sprint-03/feat/auth
      last_commit: abc123
notes: "Working on auth module, 2 tests remain"
```

**State loading priority (spec §12.6):**

| Priority | File | Load when |
|----------|------|-----------|
| 1 | status.yaml | Always |
| 2 | profile.yaml | Always |
| 3 | config.yaml | Always |
| 4 | backlog.yaml (sprint only) | Always |
| 5 | backlog.yaml (pool) | On demand |
| 6 | decisions.md (last 5) | On demand |
| 7 | sources.yaml | During COLLECT |
| 8 | decisions-auto.log | Never auto |

Essential context: ~100-200 lines. Agent must NEVER load all at once.

### 5.17 Additional Skill Extensions (G-008 to G-014, G-025 to G-028)

**P16 pushback — full signal tracking (G-008):**
In addition to the `consecutive_acceptances` counter, track:
- User never selects "Discuss" → `never_discusses` boolean
- User responds with single-word confirmations → `terse_responses` counter
- User never modifies proposals → `never_modifies` boolean
- User never asks "why?" → `never_questions` boolean
All signals stored in `status.yaml`. Threshold calibrated by expertise.

**Documentation as first-class artefact (G-010):**
When `/gse:produce` handles a TASK with `artefact_type: doc`:
- Auto-generate API docs from code docstrings if available
- Generate in the worktree branch `gse/sprint-NN/docs/<name>`
- Review alongside code artefacts

**Dependency audit (G-011):**
When `/gse:tests` runs, if `testing.dependency_audit: true`:
```bash
pip-audit  # or npm audit, depending on detected framework
```
Report findings in health alerts as `⚠ DEPS:` items.

**Framework drift detection (G-014):**
At start of `/gse:tests --run` or `/gse:produce`:
- Compare current framework (from package manifest) with `config.yaml → testing.framework`
- If different → Inform: "Framework changed from X to Y. Update config?"

**Tutor agent — Design Mechanics (spec P14 + `agents/tutor.md`):**

The tutor is a dedicated specialized sub-agent responsible for the **pedagogical dimension** of GSE-One. Modeled after the other advocates (architect, security-auditor, ux-advocate, devil-advocate): separate agent file, fresh context on invocation, narrow mandate.

**Why a dedicated agent (and not orchestrator-inline):**
- Keeps the orchestrator lean — no inline pedagogical reasoning algorithm
- Fresh context = objective evaluation (pedagogical judgment not polluted by project-execution details)
- Extensible: the `agents/tutor.md` file contains a *"Pedagogical recipes"* section that both the user (manual edit) and the agent (auto-update via `/gse:compound` Axe 3) can maintain
- Pattern consistent with `devil-advocate.md` (invoked at specific moments, returns a verdict, orchestrator acts on it)

**Invocation contract:**

Invoked by the orchestrator at:
- Activity start (any of the 15 lifecycle activities) when `profile.yaml → dimensions.learning_goals` is non-empty AND `config.yaml → pedagogy.enabled: true`
- Before a Gate decision with high pedagogical load (stack choice, architecture, persistence strategy)
- After detected friction patterns (repeated questions, hesitations, explicit confusion — if `proactive_gap_detection: true`)
- During `/gse:compound` Axe 3 (competency capitalization)

**Inputs passed to the tutor:**
- Activity name + what it will concretely exercise (technique, pattern, tasks)
- `profile.yaml → dimensions.learning_goals` (free text)
- `docs/learning/LRN-*` (list + metadata)
- `status.yaml → learning_preambles[]` (previous interactions and responses)
- `status.yaml → detected_gaps[]` (for inferred-gap trigger)

**Outputs (returned to orchestrator):**

```yaml
tutor_decision:
  verdict: skip | propose
  # if skip:
  reason: "already covered (LRN-002)" | "previously declined" | "cap reached" | "no overlap" | ...
  # if propose:
  topic: "{precise formulation, 1 sentence}"
  trigger: explicit-goal | inferred-gap | gate-preamble | compound-review
  preamble:
    core_concept: "{1-2 sentences}"
    example: "{concrete 3-10 line example}"
    pitfall: "{common mistake + fix hint}"
  suggested_depth: quick | deep
```

On `propose`, the orchestrator presents the 5-option P14 Gate to the user. On Quick or Deep acceptance, the tutor writes the learning note (LRN-NNN) and persists the interaction.

**Persistence model:**

| Field | Location | Lifecycle |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| `learning_preambles[]` | `.gse/status.yaml` | Per-project, survives pauses/resumes |
| `detected_gaps[]` | `.gse/status.yaml` | Per-project, reviewed at each `/gse:compound` |
| Learning notes | `docs/learning/LRN-*.md` | Per-project, durable artefacts with traces |
| Pedagogical recipes | `gse-one/plugin/agents/tutor.md` Recipes section | **Edit destination:** the user-local copy in `.claude/agents/tutor.md` / `.cursor/agents/tutor.md` (per-project recipes) OR the shipped template (shared defaults) |

**Pedagogical recipes — dual maintenance:**

1. **User-edit path:** user manually edits the project-local `tutor.md` copy to add project-specific or personal pedagogy (e.g., "prefer code examples in TypeScript", "always include a security caveat when discussing auth").
2. **Agent auto-update path:** during `/gse:compound` Axe 3, if the tutor observes that a specific presentation strategy worked well (or poorly), it proposes a new recipe or update to the user via Gate. Approved updates are written to the same project-local file.

**Anti-spam architecture:**

- Sprint cap (`pedagogy.max_preambles_per_sprint`) — hard budget per sprint
- Per-topic permanent suppress (`not-interested` response)
- Per-topic activity-scope suppress (`not-now` response)
- LRN deduplication (if LRN exists on the topic, don't re-propose unless user requests refresh)
- Empty-goals skip: if `learning_goals` is empty AND `proactive_gap_detection: false`, the tutor is never invoked

**Failure modes:**

- Tutor sub-agent fails to return → orchestrator proceeds without preamble, logs an Inform note
- `learning_goals` malformed → tutor skips with "invalid profile input" reason; orchestrator surfaces a warning
- Multiple topics match → tutor picks the most contextually relevant (matching the activity's current work); cap enforced

**Policy tests — Design Mechanics (spec §6 Policy column):**

Policy tests enforce **structural rules** on the codebase via static analysis. They are a first-class test level in the pyramid (5% baseline, adjustable 10-15% for strict architecture projects), distinct from the Other column which contains dynamic-constraint checks.

**Categories of policy tests:**

| Category | Rule examples |
|----------|---------------|
| Architecture layering | `src/domain/** must not import src/ui/**`; `no circular imports`; `public API lives only in src/api/` |
| License compliance | `no GPL-licensed dependency`; `all deps must have license metadata` |
| Naming conventions | `all public functions start with lowercase`; `test files match pattern test_*.py` |
| File / module constraints | `no file > 500 lines`; `no function > 50 lines`; `no module with > 20 imports` |
| Dependency rules | `no deprecated packages`; `dev deps not imported in src/`; `version pins match policy` |
| Docstring / documentation | `all public functions must have a docstring`; `all public classes must have an example` |

**Tooling per language (suggestions, not prescriptive):**

| Language | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Python | `pytest-archon` (architecture), `grimp` (import graph), `pip-licenses` (licenses), `ruff` (conventions) |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `ts-arch` / `dependency-cruiser` (architecture), `license-checker` (licenses), `eslint` with custom rules |
| Java | `ArchUnit` (architecture), `license-maven-plugin` (licenses) |
| Go | `go-arch-lint` (architecture), `go-licenses` |
| Rust | `cargo-deny` (licenses, deps, advisories), custom macros for architecture |
| Language-agnostic | Custom grep / AST scanners in shell or Python as CI scripts |

**Integration in `/gse:tests`:**

At strategy definition time (Step 1 of `/gse:tests --strategy`), the agent scans:

- `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/design.md` — specifically the *Architecture Overview*, *Component Diagram*, and *Shared State* sections. If layered architecture is documented (e.g., "domain layer / storage layer / UI layer") → propose a policy test enforcing the layering.
- `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/decisions.md` — DEC- entries with architectural rules (e.g., "DEC-005: framework-free domain module") → propose a policy test enforcing the rule.
- `config.yaml → project.domain` — apply the baseline Policy percentage from the pyramid.

Proposals are presented as Inform-tier suggestions with concrete tool recommendations for the project's language. The user accepts, adjusts, or declines. Each accepted policy test gets its own TST-NNN artefact with `level: policy` in its frontmatter.

**Execution characteristics:**

Policy tests must be:
- **Fast** — full run in seconds (static scan, no runtime)
- **Deterministic** — pass/fail is a function of code state, not environment
- **Actionable on failure** — the message names the violating file + the rule + the fix hint

Run at the same points as other test levels (pre-commit hook, CI pipeline, `/gse:tests --run`). Failures block `/gse:produce` / `/gse:deliver` per the existing test-pass-rate guardrails.

**Why a first-class level and not a subset of Other:**

- **Other** contains *dynamic-constraint* checks attached to behavioral tests (e.g., an E2E test that also measures page load time). It is a modifier on behavioral tests.
- **Policy** is *purely structural* — no runtime, no behavior involved. It guards the codebase's shape. Confusing the two leads to under-budgeting and invisible architecture erosion.

Making Policy a first-class pyramid column forces its explicit allocation during strategy planning, which matches observed practice in mature codebases (see learner05 training feedback: *"Policy tests are surprisingly cheap and powerful — a ~60-line AST scan permanently enforces architecture decisions"*).

---

**Complexity budget ranges (G-025):**
Use the spec §8.1 range table. Agent selects within range based on context, presents as Inform. One point captures **coupled effort + complexity for the AI + user pair** (spec P10 / §8.1) with an indicative temporal anchor of 1 pt ≈ 1 pair-session hour. For maintenance work (refactoring, tests, docs, renaming, bug-fixing), apply the **Cost Assessment Grid for Maintenance Work** from spec Appendix B: four criteria (fan-out, review burden, rework risk, coupling) → 0 pt / 1 pt / 2-5 pt per item. The pre-v0.34 "zero-cost items" blanket rule is deprecated — agents must size maintenance activities case-by-case.

**Team matching algorithm (G-026):**
User detection in priority order:
1. `.gse/current-user` file → use content
2. `GSE_USER` env var → use value
3. `git config user.name` → use value
4. Ask user (Inform)
Match case-insensitive, spaces→hyphens against `.gse/profiles/`.

**Minimum viable project size (G-027):**
In lightweight mode detection: add note that for truly one-off tasks, don't use GSE-One.

**Concurrent access (G-028):**
- Each team member works in own worktree → no file conflicts during production
- `backlog.yaml` conflicts handled by git merge; agent detects on pull, proposes resolution (Gate)
- `decisions.md` is append-only → no conflicts
- Checkpoints are per-user → no conflicts

## 6. Methodology Deployment: Cross-Platform Parity

The GSE-One methodology is loaded as the agent's permanent identity on both platforms through a dual-mechanism approach, ensuring identical behavior regardless of the tool used.

### 6.1 Claude Code: Agent Reference

Claude Code uses `settings.json` to load the orchestrator agent as session identity:

```json
{
  "agent": "gse-orchestrator"
}
```

This causes Claude Code to load `agents/gse-orchestrator.md` at session start, making the full methodology body (16 principles, state management, orchestration decision tree) the agent's permanent context.

### 6.2 Cursor: Always-On Rule

Cursor uses `rules/gse-orchestrator.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true` to inject the methodology permanently into every interaction:

```yaml
---
description: "GSE-One methodology — 16 core principles, state management, orchestration decision tree. This is the agent's permanent identity."
alwaysApply: true
---
```

The body following this frontmatter is identical to the body of `agents/gse-orchestrator.md`.

### 6.3 Generation and Parity

Both files are generated from the same source: `src/agents/gse-orchestrator.md`. The generator:

1. Extracts the body (everything after the YAML frontmatter `---...---`)
2. Wraps the body with **agent frontmatter** for Claude Code (`name`, `description` fields)
3. Wraps the same body with **.mdc frontmatter** for Cursor (`description`, `alwaysApply` fields)
4. Verifies body parity at generation time — if the two generated bodies differ, the generator reports `DIVERGENT!`

This ensures that Claude Code and Cursor users experience the exact same methodology, decision logic, and orchestration behavior.

### 6.4 Installer Differentiation

Although the `plugin/` source directory contains both `agents/gse-orchestrator.md` and `rules/gse-orchestrator.mdc`, the installer (`install.py`) ensures each platform only receives the appropriate file:

- **Claude Code:** Receives `agents/gse-orchestrator.md` (loaded via `settings.json → "agent"`). The `.mdc` file is ignored by Claude.
- **Cursor:** Receives `rules/gse-orchestrator.mdc` (loaded via `alwaysApply: true`). The installer **excludes** `agents/gse-orchestrator.md` from Cursor installations to prevent the orchestrator content from being loaded twice — once as an always-on rule and once as a named agent.

Cursor still receives the 8 specialized agents (`code-reviewer.md`, `architect.md`, etc.) in `agents/` for sub-agent delegation during REVIEW and other activities.

---

## 7. Hooks Design

GSE-One implements **3 system hooks** (spec P13 — Event-Driven Behaviors) — deterministic, rigid checks where the risk of the AI forgetting is too high. All hook commands use cross-platform Python (`python3 -c`). The commands are defined as shared constants in the generator and emitted in platform-specific JSON wrappers.

| Hook | Event | Matcher | Level | Exit |
|------|-------|---------|-------|------|
| Protect main | PreToolUse | Bash | Hard | 2 (block) |
| Block force-push | PreToolUse | Bash | Emergency | 2 (block) |
| Review findings on push | PostToolUse | Bash | Informational | 0 (warn) |

Blocking hooks (exit 2) write to **stderr** so the agent receives the feedback. Informational hooks (exit 0) write to **stdout**.

### 7.1 Claude Code: `hooks/hooks.claude.json`

Claude Code uses PascalCase event names (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`) and an explicit `type` field:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 -c \"import os,subprocess,sys; t=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT',''); c=t.startswith('git commit'); b=subprocess.run(['git','branch','--show-current'],capture_output=True,text=True).stdout.strip() if c else ''; (c and b=='main') and (print('GUARDRAIL: Direct commit to main detected. Use a feature branch.',file=sys.stderr),sys.exit(2))\""
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 -c \"import os,sys; t=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT',''); t.startswith('git push --force') and (print('EMERGENCY GUARDRAIL: Force push detected. This can cause permanent data loss. Aborting.',file=sys.stderr),sys.exit(2))\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 -c \"import os,re; t=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT',''); f=os.path.join('.gse','status.yaml'); c=open(f).read() if t.startswith('git push') and os.path.isfile(f) else ''; m=re.search(r'review_findings_open:\\s*(\\d+)',c); o=int(m.group(1)) if m else 0; (o>0) and print('WARNING: '+str(o)+' open review findings')\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 7.2 Cursor: `hooks/hooks.cursor.json`

Cursor uses camelCase event names (`preToolUse`, `postToolUse`), a top-level `version` field, and omits the `type` field (implicit):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "command": "python3 -c \"import os,subprocess,sys; t=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT',''); c=t.startswith('git commit'); b=subprocess.run(['git','branch','--show-current'],capture_output=True,text=True).stdout.strip() if c else ''; (c and b=='main') and (print('GUARDRAIL: Direct commit to main detected. Use a feature branch.',file=sys.stderr),sys.exit(2))\""
          },
          {
            "command": "python3 -c \"import os,sys; t=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT',''); t.startswith('git push --force') and (print('EMERGENCY GUARDRAIL: Force push detected. This can cause permanent data loss. Aborting.',file=sys.stderr),sys.exit(2))\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "postToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "command": "python3 -c \"import os,re; t=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT',''); f=os.path.join('.gse','status.yaml'); c=open(f).read() if t.startswith('git push') and os.path.isfile(f) else ''; m=re.search(r'review_findings_open:\\s*(\\d+)',c); o=int(m.group(1)) if m else 0; (o>0) and print('WARNING: '+str(o)+' open review findings')\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 7.3 Format Differences Summary

| Aspect | Claude Code | Cursor |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Event names | PascalCase (`PreToolUse`) | camelCase (`preToolUse`) |
| `type` field | Required (`"type": "command"`) | Omitted (implicit) |
| `version` field | Absent | Required (`"version": 1`) |
| Hook commands | Identical (cross-platform Python) | Identical (cross-platform Python) |

## 8. Non-Git Project Handling

Some projects may not use git (rare but possible). The skills handle this gracefully:

```markdown
### Git Detection (run once per session)

At the start of any skill that involves git:
1. Check if `.git` exists in the project root
2. If not: set `git_available = false`
3. If yes: read `.gse/config.yaml` → `git.strategy`

If `git_available` is false OR `git.strategy` is `none`:
- Skip all git operations silently
- Do not mention branches, worktrees, or merges
- Work directly on files in place
- Health dashboard omits the "Git hygiene" sub-dimension (score out of 6 dimensions)
- Log: `Inform: git not available or disabled — working without version control`

If this is the first session and git IS available but `git.strategy` is not set:
- **Gate decision**: "This project uses git. How should GSE-One manage branches?"
  1. Worktree (recommended) — isolated directories per task
  2. Branch-only — branches without worktrees (simpler but requires switching)
  3. None — no branch management (GSE-One won't touch git)
```

---

## 9. Marketplace & Distribution

The `marketplace.json` install path is `"plugin"` (not `"dist/claude"`), reflecting the mono-plugin architecture.

---

## 10. Shared Project State (`.gse/`)

```
.gse/                               # Created by /gse:hug or /gse:go

```

### 10.1 Sprint Plan Lifecycle (`.gse/plan.yaml`)

`.gse/plan.yaml` is a **living document** maintained by the orchestrator, not a static artefact. Its schema (goal, tasks, budget, workflow, coherence, risks) is defined in `src/activities/plan.md`.

**Creation** — Written by `/gse:plan --strategic` at sprint start. `workflow.expected` is initialized from the project mode:

| Mode | workflow.expected |
|------|-------------------|
| Full | `[collect, assess, plan, reqs, design, tests, produce, review, deliver]` (plus `preview` after `design` for web/mobile) |
| Lightweight | `[plan, reqs, produce, deliver]` |
| Micro | no `plan.yaml` — orchestrator falls back to file-existence checks |

**Maintenance** — After every activity transition, the orchestrator executes the **Sprint Plan Maintenance** protocol (defined in `gse-orchestrator.md`):
1. Move current activity from `workflow.active` to `workflow.completed` (with `completed_at` + notes).
2. **Post-REVIEW mutation (conditional FIX insertion):** If the activity just completed is `review`: if `review.md` contains at least one finding with severity HIGH or MEDIUM → insert `fix` at the head of `workflow.pending`. If no such finding exists → do not insert `fix`; if `fix` was previously in `workflow.expected`, move it to `workflow.skipped` with `reason: "no review findings"`.
3. Pop the next item from `workflow.pending` → `workflow.active`; record conditional skips in `workflow.skipped` with reason.
4. Evaluate non-blocking coherence: `budget_pressure` (>80% consumed with tasks remaining), `significant_scope_drift` (>50% tasks changed), `velocity_risk` (produce phase only).
5. React by mode: Full → Inform; Lightweight → one-line Inform; Micro → silent.
6. Update `status.yaml` cursor fields (`last_activity`, `last_activity_timestamp`, `lifecycle_phase`).

**Archival** — At DELIVER Step 9, the orchestrator reads `.gse/plan.yaml`, generates `docs/sprints/sprint-{NN}/plan-summary.md` (using the `plan-summary.md` template), and sets `plan.yaml.status: completed`. The snapshot is read-only — never consumed by the orchestrator, only used for human reference and COMPOUND process-deviation analysis.

**Reset** — At the start of the next sprint, `/gse:plan --strategic` overwrites `.gse/plan.yaml` with a fresh plan for the new sprint. The prior sprint's `plan-summary.md` remains in its sprint directory as the durable archive.

**Resilience** — `.gse/plan.yaml` is validated on write (YAML parseable). On corruption, the orchestrator restores from the latest checkpoint in `.gse/checkpoints/` and reports the error.

**.gitignore additions** (applied by `/gse:hug` on first run):

```gitignore
# GSE-One worktrees (managed by /gse:produce and /gse:deliver)
.worktrees/

# GSE-One local state (user-specific)
.gse/checkpoints/
.gse/decisions-auto.log
```

## 14. Open Questions

| # | Question | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | ~~Should GSE-One principles be in `settings.json` agent key or separate skills?~~ | ~~Context efficiency~~ | **RESOLVED.** Principles are embedded in the orchestrator agent body (`agents/gse-orchestrator.md`), which also generates the Cursor `.mdc` rule. `settings.json` contains only the agent reference. |
| 2 | Cursor marketplace or npm or both? | Reach | Both |
| 3 | How to handle `.gse/` version upgrades? | UX | `gse_version` field + migration logic in skills |
| 4 | How to handle git conflicts during deliver? | User experience | Gate decision with 3 options: resolve manually, use theirs, use ours |
| 5 | Should worktrees be created eagerly (at plan time) or lazily (at produce time)? | Resource usage | **Lazily** — create at produce time. Plan only assigns names. |
| 6 | How deep should git hygiene check go? | Scope | Start with branch-level checks. Dependency audit in Phase 4. |
| 7 | Should `.gse/` itself live on main or on each branch? | State consistency | **Main only.** Worktrees get a symlink or copy. |
| 8 | How to handle contextual tip frequency? Too many tips = annoying, too few = useless. | User experience | Max 1 tip per activity step. User can disable via HUG. Track and adapt. |
| 9 | Should external source shallow clones be cached or re-cloned each time? | Performance | Cache in `.gse/cache/` with TTL. Clean on `/gse:deliver`. |
| 10 | How to handle state recovery when user manually breaks `.gse/` or deletes branches? | Robustness | Best-effort reconstruction from git history. Warn, don't crash. |
